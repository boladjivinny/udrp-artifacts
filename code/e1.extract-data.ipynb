Fundation Private Whois / Domain Administrator, FA 1493625 (Forum May 23, 2013) (holding that enterprise-coupons.net is confusingly similar to the Complainant’s ENTERPRISE mark).<br>  Complainant alleges that Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name arguing that there is nothing in the WHOIS record for &lt;nayionalcarrental.com&gt; to indicate that Respondent is commonly known as, operating a business as, or advertising as “nayionalcarrental.” Previous panels have found that, in the absence of evidence submitted by the respondent, the WHOIS record is the sole piece of relevant evidence when determining how a respondent is commonly known. Citing Haas Automation, Inc. v. Machine Tools 24-7/ Jon Beal, FA1201001425055 (Forum Feb. 29, 2012) (“Respondent may well be known in the community as a vendor of used Haas equipment, but it has not shown that it is known as such by the name HAAS. The relevant evidence presented consists exclusively of the WHOIS information”).<br>  Complainant adds that even if Respondent were operating a business known as “nayionalcarrental,” (which Complainant denies based upon information and belief) she would not have rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name. Previous panels have found that using a trademark term in an unauthorized manner in a domain name, even where Respondent is operating an actual business, causes confusion by illegitimately indicating to consumers that the products at the contested domain name are those of the trademark holder.

Com-Union Corp., D2000-0020 (WIPO Mar. 14, 2000) (finding no rights or legitimate interest where the respondent was not commonly known by the mark and never applied for a license or permission from the complainant to use the trademarked name).<br>  Referring to screen capture of the web site to which the disputed domain name resolved on March 29, 2021, which is annexed to the Complaint, Complainant alleges that at various times, the disputed domain name variously redirected to the “Last Minute Specials” webpage of Complainant’s licensee’s website at nationalcar.com and to the main website of a named car manufacturer, and/or attempted to install malware onto user’s computers. Complainant submits that while it is difficult for Complainant to demonstrate the redirects as they occur, the screen captures of the malware alerts generated by attempting to access establish this point.<br>  Complainant contends that such use of a domain name to distribute malware in a likely illegal scheme by the Respondent is not a legitimate use of the disputed domain name and does not give the Respondent any rights in the &lt;nayionalcarrental.com&gt; domain name.

Citing Coachella Music Festival, LLC v. Carolina Rodrigues / Fundacion Comercio Electronico, FA 1785199 (Forum June 5, 2018) (“Respondent uses the &lt;coechella.com&gt; domain name to direct internet users to a website which is used to attempt to install malware on visiting devices. Using the domain name in this manner is neither a bona fide offering of goods or services under Policy ¶ 4(c)(i), nor a non-commercial or fair use under Policy ¶ 4(c)(iii).”).<br>  Complainant also alleges that the disputed domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith, arguing that, considering Complainant’s worldwide reputation for car rental services under its NATIONAL CAR RENTAL mark and its nearly 75 years of use of its NATIONAL CAR RENTAL mark, it seems likely that Respondent registered the disputed domain name with full knowledge of Complainant’s rights in its mark. Citing Enterprise Holdings, Inc. v. Domain Manager/Domain Escrow, FA 1205001444228 (Forum June 28, 2012) (“The Panel finds that, due to the fame of Complainant’s [ENTERPRISE] mark, Respondent had actual knowledge of the mark and Complainant’s rights.”).<br>  Complainant adds that the registration and use of the disputed domain name is a deliberate attempt to deliberately use NATIONAL CAR RENTAL mark in the disputed domain name to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to its website, by creating a likelihood of confusion with Complainant’s mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of its website and the services offered at such websites.<br>  Complainant further argues that Respondent’s use of the &lt;nayionalcarrental.com&gt; domain name to distribute malware demonstrates that the &lt;nayionalcarrental.com&gt; domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith. Citing Dell Inc. v. Whois Manager / Whois Privacy Management Service, FA 1803001778749 (Forum May 9, 2018) (The “[u]se of a domain name to resolve to a website that distributes malicious software may evidence bad faith registration and use pursuant to Policy ¶ 4(a)(iii).”).<br>  Referring to a screen capture of the results of a search on MX lookup service which has been annexed to the Complaint, Complainant submits that it shows that Respondent has taken affirmative steps to set up MX records for the &lt;nayionalcarrental.com&gt; domain name. Complainant submits that email capability is not needed for parked domains and argues that this Panel may therefore take an inference of bad faith intent. Citing The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited v.
