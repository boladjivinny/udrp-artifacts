"xiamenshi, \u201cAlabama, United States\u201d. First, the Complainants have a specific common grievance against the Respondents because the Complainant Provent Holdings Ltd. licensed the use of its M88 trademarks and its domain names incorporating the M88 trademark to the Complainant Harmony Park International Inc. Second, it would be equitable and procedurally efficient to permit the consolidation because the Domain Names are likely to be owned by the same person (the \u201cRespondent\u201d). The evidence on file shows that the registrants\u2019 email addresses for the Domain Names are identical, the Domain Names resolve to websites with identical content, which replicates content of a website associated with the Complainants\u2019 domain names and the Domain Names are registered with the same Registrar. WhoIs information reveals that both websites have the same IP address. It would be unjust to force each of the Complainants to incur additional costs by making them file a separate complaint. Thus, the consolidation is proper.\n4. Factual Background\nThe Complainants own several trademark registrations and applications for trademark registration in the M88 trademark, (the \u201cM88 trademark\u201d) including the Chinese trademark registration No. 302331314 dated July 31, 2012, and trademark registration No. 41-0273819 of the Republic of Korea dated November 22, 2013 The Complainants also won several applications for trademark registration in M88.COM and several other trademarks. The Complainants operate an online casino, poker, sports book and sports exchange gaming websites connected to the <m88sb.com> domain name.\nThe Respondent registered the <m888abc.com> domain name on March 6, 2014": [

In each case, these descriptions add nothing to the distinctive character of the LAND ROVER trade mark in these combinations.\n- Disputed domain names 45 and 46 combine the LAND ROVER trade mark with the descriptive words \"electric\" and \"hybrid\". The word \"electric\" is a descriptive word used in relation to vehicles powered with an electric engine and the word \"hybrid\" is a descriptive word used in connection with vehicles which incorporate both a fuel engine and an electric engine.\n- Disputed domain names 47 and 48 combine the trade mark RANGE ROVER with the geographic name of the country \"Australia\".\n- Disputed domain names 49 to 63 each incorporate the trade mark RANGE ROVER with the name of a territory or capital city in Australia, i.e., \"ACT\" (Australian Capital Territory), \"Canberra\", \"Darwin\", \"Hobart\", \"Brisbane\", \"Melbourne\", \"Perth\", \"Adelaide\" and \"Sydney\".\n- Disputed domain names 64 to 109 combine the trade mark RANGE ROVER with geographical terms being the names of towns, regions or suburbs in Australia, i.e., \"Port Lincoln\", \"Albany\", \"Alexandria\", \"Alice Springs\", \"Artarmon\", \"Bennetts Green\", \"Blakehurst\", \"Brighton\", \"Brookvale\", \"Cairns\", \"Cannington\", \"Coffs Harbour\", \"Doncaster\", \"Geelong\", \"Gold Coast\", \"Hawthorn\", \"Indooroopilly\", \"Taringa\", \"Toowong\", \"Malvern\", \"Launceston\", \"Lavington\", \"Mackay\", \"Maroochydore\", \"Millicent\", \"Narellan\", \"Osborne Park\", \"Parramatta\", \"Morwell\", \"Mosman\", \"Orange\", \"Port Macquarie\", \"Bundaberg\", \"Dubbo\", \"Southport\", \"Tamworth\", \"Toowoomba\", \"Townsville\" and \"Wollongong\".\n- Disputed domain names 110 to 113 combine the trade mark RANGE ROVER with the geographical indications \"north\", \"south\", \"west\" and \"city\".\n- Disputed domain names 114 to 116 combine the trade marks RANGE ROVER with the Respondent's name Trivett, the non-distinctive term \"hse\" and the non-distinctive designation \".net.au\".\n- Disputed domain names 117 to 132 combine the trade mark RANGE ROVER with various descriptive words, being respectively, \"my\", \"finance\", \"new\", \"capped price servicing\", \"leasing\", \"service centre\", \"sport\", \"service my\", \"service\", \"preowned\", \"capped price service\", \"fixed price service\", \"parts\", \"review\", \"spare parts\" and \"warranty\".\n- Disputed domain names 133 to 136 combine the trade mark RANGE ROVER with the words \"electric\" and \"hybrid\" respectively. In the combination \"Range Rover Electric\", the word \"electric\" makes reference to a vehicle powered by an electric engine. In the combination \"Range Rover Hybrid\", the word \"hybrid\" makes reference to a vehicle powered by a hybrid engine.\n- Disputed domain name 137 combines the trade mark JAGUAR with the geographic name of the country \"Australia\".\n- Disputed domain names 138 to 142 combine the trade mark JAGUAR with the name of a capital city in Australia, namely \"Darwin\", \"Canberra\", \"Adelaide\", \"Brisbane\" and \"Hobart\".\n- Disputed domain names 143 to 161 combine the trade mark JAGUAR with geographical terms being the names of towns, regions or suburbs in Australia, namely, \"Wollongong\", \"Townsville\", \"Osborne Park\", \"Mosman\", \"Taringa\", \"Toowong\", \"Coffs Harbour\", \"Malvern\", \"Launceston\", \"Lavington\", \"Narellan\", \"Maroochydore\", \"Southport\", \"Millicent\", \"Morwell\", \"Orange\", \"Albany\" and \"Alexandria\".\n- Disputed domain names 162 to 164 combine the trade mark JAGUAR with the geographical indications \"west\", \"north\" and \"south\".\n- Disputed domain names 165 to 173 combine the trade mark JAGUAR with the descriptive words \"service\", \"maintain my\", \"service my\", \"my\", \"capped price service\", \"fixed price service\", \"review\", \"spare parts\" and \"warranty\".\n- Disputed domain names 174 and 175 combine the trade mark JAGUAR with the descriptive words \"hybrid\" and \"electric\".\nThe Complainant submits that it is well settled that the use of a well-known mark in its entirety, together with a geographic term or a descriptive term in a domain name, creates a domain name that is confusingly similar to the well-known mark. Accordingly the Complainant submits that each of the disputed domain names is confusingly similar either to its JAGUAR, LAND ROVER or RANGE ROVER marks.\nAs far as the second element of the Policy is concerned the Complainant submits that the Respondent has not been licensed or otherwise permitted by the Complainant to use any of the JAGUAR, LAND ROVER or RANGE ROVER trade marks, or to apply for or use any domain name incorporating any of those marks or names. It further says that in light of the Complainant's numerous trade mark registrations and worldwide reputation, it is inconceivable that the Respondent did not know of the Complainant's rights and interests in the trade marks upon registration in 2014/2015.\nThe Complainant notes the cease and desist letter sent by its lawyers to the Respondent in late 2015 and the response from the Respondent's lawyers that the Respondent acquired the disputed domain names for the purpose of developing a web-based application to promote genuine parts and services and was aiming for a 2018 test release. The Complainant says that the Respondent has provided no evidence of preparations to use any of the disputed domain names in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services. Even if there were preparations to develop a web-based application to promote genuine parts and services (as claimed), such use cannot be characterised as bona fide in accordance with the principles of Oki Data Americas, Inc. v. ASD, Inc., WIPO Case No. D2001-0903.\nThe Complainant says in this regard that the Respondent is not, and has never been, known by any of the disputed domain names. Further it says that the words in each of the disputed domain names are associated exclusively with the Complainant. Finally it says that the Respondent has not acquired any trade mark or service mark rights in any of the disputed domain names.\nAs far as bad faith is concerned the Complainant says that the Respondent registered the disputed domain names in order to prevent the Complainant from reflecting its trade marks in corresponding domain names and that the number of similar domain names subject of this Complaint shows that the Respondent has engaged in a pattern of such conduct. Further says the Complainant, the Respondent has registered the disputed domain names to disrupt the business of the Complainant in Australia.\nAlthough the Complainant notes that the Respondent is not actively using any of the disputed domain names and has taken no active steps to sell any of the disputed domain names, the Complainant submits that this does not preclude a finding of bad faith use arising from inaction and passive holding based on the decision in Telstra Corporation Limited v. Nuclear Marshmallows, WIPO Case No. D2000-0003.\nThe Complainant notes that the only use to which the Respondent claims that it intends to put the disputed domain names is for a web-based application to promote genuine parts and services which is aimed to be tested in 2018.\nThe Complainant relies on the four pronged test from the Oki Data case for determining whether a third party can use a domain name for promoting the genuine parts and services of another's trade mark in good faith and says that in the instant case while it is far from clear how the Respondent intends to use the disputed domain names, it is plain that the Respondent has tried to corner the market in all relevant domain names. For example, says the Complainant, for the geographical city names the Respondent has registered not only a geographical name followed by the relevant trade mark, but in many cases the reverse combination with the relevant trade mark followed by the geographical name. As a result, says the Complainant, the Respondent's registration of the disputed domain names and its potential use of the disputed domain names could not be in good faith.\nB. Respondent\nThe Respondent does not challenge the Complainant's demonstrated trade mark rights but submits that there is no use of each disputed domain name such as would constitute trade mark infringement and that there is also no misleading or deceptive conduct. It says that a reasonable and fair-minded member of the public would exercise independent thought and apply common sense when considering whether a particular disputed domain name or page is affiliated or endorsed by a trademark owner or a particular brand. It says that as far as the disputed domain names are concerned, either in their current form or linked in some way to the Respondent's \"MaintainMy\" project, a reasonable person would not be misled into believing there was a particular relationship or affiliation between the Complainant and the Respondent and neither does the inclusion of geographical terms impugn the disputed domain names in any way. The Respondent submits that if the Complaint is to succeed under the first element of the Policy then there would need to be a finding of use made in relation to each of the disputed domain names.\nThe Respondent says that there was a legitimate commercial purpose for its registration of each of the disputed domain names being for the purpose of its potential \"MaintainMy\" web platform which will connect consumers to a range of service providers, including manufacturers of both genuine and non-genuine automotive spare parts. Mr. Trivett gives evidence by declaration on behalf of the Respondent as to the steps he has taken to secure finance and the engagement of a consultant for business development advice. However the \"MaintainMy\" project is envisaged by the Respondent to be a substantial undertaking that has already taken up substantial time and is expected to take considerable further time to develop to market. It says that the work undertaken to date in this project goes well beyond merely perfunctory steps.\nThe Respondent notes that its \"MaintainMy\" project does not contemplate going \"behind\" any existing businesses, unfairly competing with existing businesses or seeking to pass itself off as having an affiliation to any businesses that it does not in fact possess. In fact it submits that a component of the project development is to liaise with suppliers of parts, which would include the Complainant, before offering services in relation to vehicles manufactured by the Complainant.\nImportantly it says that the disputed domain names do not, on the evidence, match any current dealership names or business descriptions which the Complainant uses in its marketing \u2013 for example, there is no evidence of the Complainant marketing products by reference to the geographic descriptions which form part of some of the disputed domain names. Further, according to the Respondent, the \"MaintainMy\" project will not be domiciled at the disputed domain names but rather the disputed domain names will be used (in due course) as a way of advertising the existence of the \"MaintainMy\" service to consumers who (in the present case) drive vehicles manufactured by the Complainant.\nThe Respondent notes that the content of the existing websites makes it obvious that the disputed domain names are not associated with such a large, long-established car manufacturer as the Complainant. It observes that the pages currently present only standard \"Crazy Domains\" default setting pages and that an Internet user might have interpreted a \"parking\" page some years ago as potentially belonging to a recognised brand, but no longer. It says therefore that the use of parking pages which it says are not \"pay per click\" advertising pages, does not negate the Respondent's argument that it has a legitimate interest in the disputed domain names. It notes as set out in Mr. Trivett's declaration that the Respondent intends for future content on the disputed websites to prominently disclose the true relationship (or lack of relationship) between the sites and the Complainant and is not trying to improperly associate itself with the Complainant or its trade marks. Finally under the second element, the Respondent says that it has not attempted to \"corner the market\" by registering a series of domain names that reflect the Complainant's trademarks.\nAs far as bad faith is concerned the Respondent says that there is no evidence for the assertion that the Respondent has registered the disputed domain names to prevent the Complainant from reflecting its trade marks in corresponding domain names and that the Complainant had ample opportunity to register any of the disputed domain names in the decades prior to the Respondent's registration. Neither says the Respondent is there any evidence that the Respondent has either intended to disrupt, or has actually disrupted, any part of the Complainant's business by the registration of any or all of the disputed domain names and in fact this would be very unlikely, says the Respondent, in view of its requirement for the Complainant's approval of its project. Further, the Respondent notes that it is not actively using any of the disputed domain names and has taken no active steps to sell any of the disputed domain names. It says that there is no particular significance in the fact that the Respondent has taken time in developing the \"MaintainMy\" project. The Telstra decision also indicates that passive holding alone does not establish bad faith \u2013 rather, all of the circumstances of the case must be taken into account and that these circumstances are not present in the current case as the Respondent has not failed to correspond with the Complainant, has not made extortionate transfer claims against it and has not sought to profit from the parked disputed domain names.\nThe Respondent says that the matters set out above indicate that the considerations set out in the Oki Data caseare satisfied in favour of the Respondent in the present case. The goods and services to be offered by the Respondent under the currently-in-progress project are of genuine interest to consumers. There is no suggestion of a \"bait and switch\" or entrapment process being used. The \"MaintainMy\" project explicitly distinguishes between genuine and non-genuine parts and Mr. Trivett confirms that the relationship (if any) between the Complainant and the Respondent will be accurately described in the website that is yet to be developed so that there can be no suggestion of passing off. The Respondent also submits that it has not sought to corner the market in domain names because no domain name that the Complainant might wish to register for itself has been registered by the Complainant. The Respondent notes that if the Complainant genuinely wished to register any of the disputed domain names it could be inferred that the Complainant with (1) decades of market presence (2) competent legal representation and (3) a suite of trade marks could have done so long ago had it considered it prudent to do so.\n6. Discussion and Findings\nA. Identical or Confusingly Similar\nThe Complainant has demonstrated that it owns registered trade mark rights in Australia for its marks, including Australian trade mark 83411 for the word mark JAGUAR registered since 1945, Australian trade mark number 96332 for LAND ROVER registered since 1948 and Australian trade mark 230454 for RANGE ROVER registered since 1969. The Panel also notes that such a high degree of recognition attaches to each of these marks in Australia and elsewhere in the world that these marks fall into the category that could truly be said to be \"well known\" marks.\nEach of the disputed domain names wholly incorporates one of these trade marks and has no other distinguishing term, or as in the large majority of cases, contains additional terms that are either geographical or ordinary English descriptive words, such as \"capped price service\", \"fixed price service\", \"finance\", \"service\", \"review\", \"electric\", \"warranty\", \"spare parts\", \"pre-owned\", \"hybrid\", \"sport\" or pro-nominal expressions such as \"my\" and \"maintain my\". The only exceptions to this are the disputed domain names <rangeroverhse.com.au> and <trivettrangerover.com.au>.\nThe Panel notes that, contrary to the Respondent's submissions, the assessment of confusing similarity under the first element of the Policy should not be confused with a test for trade mark infringement. The test under the first element is essentially a test of standing and the relevant assessment as undertaken by the majority of panels in .auDRP cases (and as also noted at paragraph 1.2 of the WIPO Overview of Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions, Second Edition and paragraph 1.2 of the auDA Overview of Panel Views on Selected auDRP Questions First Edition) in circumstances that the Complainant's trade mark has been wholly incorporated into the disputed domain name is a simple side by side comparison of the disputed domain names and the Complainant's mark in order to assess whether the additional term distinguishes the disputed domain name adequately from the Complainant's mark.\nThe Panel has reviewed each of the disputed domain names, not including in this category the disputed domain names <rangeroverhse.com.au> and <trivettrangerover.com.au> and finds that neither the inclusion of the geographical terms nor of any the ordinary English words noted above has the effect of distinguishing any of the disputed domain names from the relevant Complainant's highly distinctive and well known trade marks. Accordingly, the Panel finds that each of these disputed domain names is either identical or confusingly similar to either the JAGUAR, LANDROVER or RANGEROVER trade marks as are incorporated into each example in this category of disputed domain names.\nThe disputed domain names <rangeroverhse.com.au> and <trivettrangerover.com.au> in the list above do not fit into this category. While each of these disputed domain names wholly incorporates the Complainant's well known RANGEROVER mark, one incorporates the letters \"hse\" and the other includes the surname \"Trivett\". The Panel finds that the addition of the letters \"hse\" does not distinguish the disputed domain name <rangeroverhse.com.au> from the Complainant's highly distinctive and well known RANGEROVER mark. Further, the addition of the surname \"Trivett\" is in the Panel's view not sufficient to escape a finding of confusing similarity under the first element of the Policy with the Complainant's RANGEROVER mark.\nAs a result the Panel finds that the Complaint succeeds under the first element of the Policy in relation to each and every one of disputed domain names.\nB. Rights or Legitimate Interests\nThe Complainant has submitted that the Respondent has not been licensed or otherwise permitted by the Complainant to use any of the JAGUAR, LAND ROVER or RANGE ROVER trade marks, or to apply for or use any domain name incorporating any of those marks or names. The Panel notes the acknowledgement in the Respondent's submissions that it was well aware of these three trade marks at the time that it registered the disputed domain names.\nThe Complainant alleges that there is no evidence of preparations to use the disputed domain names in connection with a bona fide offering of goods and services.\nIn considering this issue it is appropriate to consider the Oki Data criteria which, as acknowledged by both parties, previous panels have used to assess whether a respondent's use of a complainant's mark in a disputed domain name amounts to bona fide use or not using the analysis from Oki Data Americas, Inc. v. ASD, Inc., supra.\nIn the Oki Data case the panel set out four minimum factor requirements as follows in helping to decide whether a respondent was possibly making a bone fide use of the disputed domain name, or not:\nRespondent must actually be offering the goods or services at issue. See World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. v.Ringside Collectibles, WIPO Case No. D2000-1306 (respondent failed to show demonstrable preparations to use the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering);\n- Respondent must use the site to sell only the trademarked goods; otherwise, it could be using the trademark to bait Internet users and then switch them to other goods. Nikon, Inc. v. Technilab, WIPO Case No. D2000-1774 (use of Nikon-related domain names to sell Nikon and competitive cameras not a legitimate use); M.F.H. Fejleszt\u00f5 Korl\u00e1tolt Felel\u00f5ss\u00e9g\u00fb Tvrsas\u00e1g v. Dany Daniele, D2015-0639;\n- The site must accurately disclose the registrant's relationship with the trademark owner; it may not, for example, falsely suggest that it is the trademark owner, or that the website is the official site, if, in fact, it is only one of many sales agents. See Houghton Mifflin Co. v. Weatherman, Inc., WIPO Case No. D2001-0211 (no bona fide offering where website's use of Complainant's logo, and lack of any disclaimer, suggested that website was the official Curious George website); R.T. Quaife Engineering v. Luton, WIPO Case No. D2000-1201 (no bona fide offering because domain name <quaifeusa.com> improperly suggested that the reflected site was the official U.S. website for Quaife, an English company; moreover, respondent's deceptive communications with inquiring consumers supported a finding of no legitimate interest); Easy Heat, Inc. v. Shelter Prods., WIPO Case No. D2001-0344 (no bona fide use when respondent suggested that it was the manufacturer of complainant's products); Grundfos Holding A/S v. Ahmed Alshahri, WIPO Case No. D2015-1112;\n- The Respondent must not try to corner the market in all domain names, thus depriving the trademark owner of reflecting its own mark in a domain name. Magnum Piering, Inc. v. Mudjackers, WIPO Case No. D2000-1525 (\"a single distributor is extremely unlikely to have a legitimate interest in precluding others from using numerous variants on a mark\"); Johnson & Johnson v. Ebubekir Ozdogan, WIPO Case No. D2015-1031.\nThe application of these factors to a case such as the current one in which the re-seller is unauthorized was confirmed by the panel in National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc. v. Racing Connection / The Racin' Connection, Inc., WIPO Case No. D2007-1524and the approach was adopted quite recently by this panel under the .auDRP in BlueScope Steel Limited v. Jye Fulton, WIPOCase No. DAU2016-0029.\nAs noted above, the Respondent submits that it has registered the disputed domain names for the purposes of developing its proposed \"Maintain My\" web platform which will connect consumers to a range of service providers, including manufacturers of both genuine and non-genuine automotive spare parts.\nAlthough this business is not yet up and running it is clear based on the statutory declaration of Mr. Trivett that it is under development albeit that it is a substantial project and will take some time to get to launch point. As part of this platform it is apparent that the Respondent intends to offer services in relation to JAGUAR, LANDROVER and RANGEROVER spare parts. It seems that a key part of preparations for the business to date has been registration of the disputed domain names. However, the Respondent acknowledges that the disputed domain names are to be used to drive traffic to the Respondent's website and have been registered for this purpose; in this regard and as further discussed below in relation to the fourth Oki Data factor, the Respondent's registration of the disputed domain names for such purpose cannot be considered as being demonstrable preparations for a bona fide purpose.\nRegarding the second requirement of Oki Data, the Respondent maintains that there is no suggestion of a \"bait and switch\" or entrapment process being used here. It says that the \"MaintainMy\" project will explicitly distinguish between genuine and non-genuine parts and that Mr. Trivett confirms in his declaration that the relationship (if any) between the Complainant and the Respondent will be accurately described in the website that is yet to be developed so that there can be no suggestion of passing off. The Panel also notes Mr. Trivett's acknowledgement that the Respondent intends to seek the Complainant's approval for its website use of the Complainant's trade marks and therefore infers that this will not be a \"bait and switch\" case and that the Complainant will in any event have the opportunity to check the manner of use and mechanism of the website to ensure prior to launch that this is not a case of \"bait and switch\" and that no infringing use is made of the Complainant's trade marks.\nAs to the third Oki Data factor, Mr. Trivett has expressly confirmed in his declaration that the proposed \"MaintainMy\" website will accurately disclose the registrant's relationship with the trade mark owner; and will not suggest that it is the trademark owner, or that the website is the Complainant's official site. Therefore at this point the Panel is satisfied as to the Respondent's future intentions in this regard.\nThe application of the fourth Oki Data factor presents a further difficulty for the Respondent. In registering 175 domain names containing the Complainant's trade marks, the Panel must determine whether the Respondent has tried to corner the market in all domain names, thus depriving the Complainant of reflecting its own mark in a domain name.\nThe Panel notes that the Respondent says that the web platform will not be domiciled at the disputed domain names but rather will be used as a way of advertising the existence of the \"MaintainMy\" service to consumers who drive vehicles manufactured by the Complainant.\nThe Respondent expressly asserts that it is not trying to corner the market in this way. It says that the disputed domain names do not, on the evidence, match any current dealership names or business descriptions which the Complainant uses in its marketing \u2013 for example, there is no evidence of the Complainant marketing products by reference to the geographic descriptions which form part of some of the disputed domain names. In other words it seems to the Panel that the disputed domain names will be used in on-line advertising programmes to trigger advertisements or possibly links to the parts of the Respondent's web platform that are relevant to consumers who drive the Complainant's vehicles.\nThe fact remains that the Respondent has registered 175 domain names that each contain the Complainant's trade marks together with geographical or common English terms except in two cases (namely disputed domain names <rangeroverhse.com.au> and <trivettrangerover.com.au>) which the Panel will discuss further below. As noted under the first element there are no distinguishing elements in these disputed domain names and the Respondent has as noted by the Complainant registered not only a geographical name followed by the relevant trade mark, but in many cases the reverse combination with the relevant trade mark followed by the geographical name. The Panel also notes that in every case and as confirmed by the Respondent, these are for its own commercial purposes and not for a legitimate non-commercial purpose. While the Respondent may not have sought to register domain names that are directly apposite to the Complainant's local Australian dealers, in the Panel's view Internet users seeing the disputed domain names would at first glance expect them to relate to websites affiliated with or authorised by the Complainant and the Complainant will be potentially deprived in the future from seeking to register these domain names. In these circumstances the Panel fails to see how registering 173 domain names containing a trade mark owner's well known marks without distinguishing elements does not amount to an attempt to corner the market in relevant domain names.\nThe two domain names that do not merely contain geographical terms or common English words, namely domain names <rangeroverhse.com.au> and <trivettrangerover.com.au> all feature the Complainant's well known marks and in the Panel's view on first glance Internet users would also reasonably assume that the Respondent's use of the particular disputed domain name was authorised by, or that the Respondent was an affiliate or re-seller of the Complainant's products.\nHad the Respondent been able to point to evidence that it had developed trade mark rights in its proposed \"MaintainMy\" mark, and had it been able to suggest that its Trivett family members sold Range Rover vehicles then, all other things being equal and supposing that there was no evidence to support the allegation that it had attempted to corner the market in relevant domain names, the result might have been different under this element of the Policy. However no such evidence has been put forward and in the circumstances the Panel finds that the Respondent has failed to rebut the case made out by the Complainant that the Respondent has attempted to corner the market in relevant domain names.\nThe Panel notes that the Respondent has registered other domain names for its \"MaintainMy\" project that do not contain the Complainant's or any other party's trade marks and it was perfectly entitled to do so. However in relation to the disputed domain names the Panel finds that the Respondent's case has not met the criteria set out in the Oki Data case\nThe Respondent might have been able to succeed under this element if it had only sought to register disputed domain names that contained an adequate distinguisher in circumstances that the other criteria of the Oki Data guidelines were fulfilled. It is not legitimate for a party to seek to register 175 domain names for commercial purposes where those domain names wholly incorporate a third party's well known trade marks without any proper distinguisher and without the trade mark owner's authority. For these reasons the Complaint succeeds under the second element of the Policy.\nC. Registered or Subsequently Used in Bad Faith\nIt is clear that the Respondent and its \"moving spirit\" Mr. Trivett, who has many years' experience as a car dealer across Australia for a whole range of brands of motor vehicle (although not for the brands at issue in this Complaint), were well aware of the Complainant's trade marks at the date of registration of each of the disputed domain names. Mr. Trivett has in fact confirmed in his declaration that he is very cognizant of the intellectual property rights of vehicle manufacturers and that he will need the involvement and support of every manufacturer of any vehicle brand involved in his \"MaintainMy\" project concerning in particular parts, compliance and up to date servicing information. He notes that obtaining this support has to date proved to be one of the major challenges of the project.\nIn this light it is extremely surprising that the Respondent, at Mr. Trivett's direction, sought to register 175 domain names that wholly incorporate the Complainant's very well-known trade marks without first seeking the Complainant's authority. The rationale according to Mr. Trivett was to register all of the key domain names that would be necessary in order to maximize the effectiveness of a strategy to build on-line traffic around the particular brands for the benefit of the \"Maintain My\" project. He submits that he expressly instructed the consultant not to register domain names that might include business names of the Complainant's dealers or businesses. However it seems that at this early stage of the project neither he nor his Internet consultant considered the likely attitude of the Complainant to the Respondent's wide ranging domain name registration scheme, or to the need to obtain the future support and co-operation of brand owners, such as the Complainant.\nThe overwhelming inference is that the Respondent, for its own commercial purposes and as directed by Mr. Trivett, effectively sought to corner the market in relevant domain names incorporating the well-known JAGUAR, LANDROVER and RANGEROVER marks in the \".au\" domain name space. The argument, as raised by the Respondent, that the Complainant had the opportunity to register these domain names for many years but has chosen not to do so, misses the point. The owner of a well-known trade mark cannot be expected to register every variation of any relevant domain name that may incorporate its well-known trade mark as a defensive measure.\nThe Respondent's domain name registration scheme was undertaken knowingly but without proper consideration of the Complainant's trade mark rights. The result might have been different had the Respondent registered a single domain name that incorporated a distinguisher in which it owned trade mark rights as well as the Complainant's brand name, provided always that the surrounding circumstances otherwise fulfilled the Oki Data requirements, particularly the actual use to which such domain name would be put. However that is certainly not the case in respect of any of the disputed domain names.\nThe Panel also notes that the Respondent alleges that the disputed domain names have been registered to drive traffic to the \"MaintainMy\" project main website. The Panel finds that the Respondent has registered the disputed domain names to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to its \"MaintainMy\" project website, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the Complainant's trade marks.\nThe Panel does not need to consider passive use as in its view and for the reasons set out above the Respondent's registration of the disputed domain names amounts to registration in bad faith. Under paragraph 4(b)(ii) of the Policy the registration of a domain name in order to prevent the owner of a name, trademark or service mark from reflecting that name or mark in a corresponding domain name is considered to be evidence of registration or use in bad faith. The Respondent's registration of the disputed domain names has effectively precluded the Complainant from registering geographical domain names in Australia that incorporate the JAGUAR, LANDROVER and RANGEROVER marks and therefore the Panel also finds that the requirements of this section of the Policy are fulfilled and that this amounts to further evidence of registration or use in bad faith.\nAs a result the Panel finds that the Complaint succeeds under this element of the policy in relation to each of the disputed domain names.\n7.

"Box 276, 130-8191 Westminster Highway, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada V6X1A7, failed to file a response to the Complaint by the due date of October 4, 2021, or at all. 3. CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES \u2022 Complainant The Complainant submits that the Disputed Domain Name <walmartrewards.ca> is, except for the <.ca> element, identical to the Complainant\u2019s registered Mark. Users of the public Internet visiting the Disputed Domain Name are directed to a website (the \u201cRegistrant\u2019s Website\u201d) which displays a series of links to services which overlap with the services covered by the Registration and include links to the Complainant\u2019s competitors, with such headings as \u201cCredit Account\u201d, \u201cApplied for Visa Credit Card Online Instant Approval\u201d, \u201cSign Up for Banks Online\u201d, and \u201cBanking Account\u201d. The Complainant alleges, given that (i) the Disputed Domain Name is identical to the Mark, (ii) the Mark is the subject of the Registration which pre-dates the registration of the Domain Name, and (iii) the Mark has been used, and has developed goodwill, throughout Canada; there can be little doubt that consumers would likely mistake the Disputed Domain Name for the Mark.  Internet users who wish to access a website operated by the Complainant either by entering a domain name including the Mark into the address bar of the Internet browser, or by entering the key term of the Disputed Domain Name into an Internet search engine, would likely be confused, and misled, by the Disputed Domain Name as a matter of first impression (a situation sometimes termed \u201cinitial interest confusion\u201d). The Complainant submits that the Registrant is using the Domain Name to attract users to the Registrant\u2019s Website through consumer confusion with the Mark and to obtain advertising revenue by posting various third-party links, including to direct competitors of the Complainant, on the Registrant\u2019s Website to re-direct consumers as the Disputed Domain Name currently resolves to a website that appears to be associated with a pay-per-click service.  The Registrant is unfairly and illegally exploiting the goodwill attached to the Complainant\u2019s Mark. The Registrant has used and registered the Domain Name in bad faith, because it registered the Disputed Domain Name to exploit the goodwill of, and cause confusion with, the Mark, and to disrupt the business of the Complainant.  The Registrant\u2019s use of the Mark in the Disputed Domain Name to attract users to the\n4  \nDomain Name: walmartrewards.ca  16133-CDRP \nRegistrant\u2019s Website through consumer confusion with the Mark, thereby creating traffic to its own website and obtaining advertising revenue from third parties, is evidence of bad faith use and registration. Finally, the Complainant alleges that the Registrant has no legitimate interests in or to the Disputed Domain Name, in that the Registrant has never been licensed or authorized to use the Mark, is not commonly known or identified by the name WALMART REWARDS, nor is WALMART REWARDS a geographical name. \u2022 Registrant The Registrant,": [

"Via Castelbelforte, 3/A, 46030 Bigarello (MN), Italia. However, according to the Respondent, the Complaint should have been filed against A.P.G. SRL, since such company is the registrant of the Domain Name, and Mr. Federico Zecchetto is only the contact person of A.P.G. SRL. Thus, it is disputed between the parties, whether the Complaint was filed against the correct Respondent. In other words, some doubts arise as to the information contained in the WhoIs records concerning the Domain Name.\nIn the view of the Panel, this issue cannot be determined in an abstract manner, but rather, it has to be examined based on the relevant circumstances of the present dispute. In the case at hand, the Panel makes the following considerations.\nFirst, the Panel refers to the email communication dated December 22, 2014 between the Center and the Registrar and notes that in its message, the Registrar stated that Mr. Federico Zecchetto is the current registrant of the Domain Name. This means that the Registrar would enforce a UDRP decision against Mr. Federico Zecchetto.\nFurthermore, taking in consideration the confirmation of the Registrar as well as the undisputed controlling position of Mr. Zecchetto within A.P.G. SRL, not admitting and substantively assessing the Complaint at hand just based on the differentiation between \u201cRegistrant Name\u201d and \u201cRegistrant Organization\u201d could be considered as an act of excessive formalism and thus be in violation of the principle of good faith. Finally, as a side note, the Panel wishes to highlight that according to the Policy, the domain name holder bears the responsibility to insert and maintain proper registration information in the Whois database.\nSecond, the Panel takes into consideration that the question of the identification of the \u201ccorrect\u201d Respondent was addressed at length in the decision Mrs. Eva Padberg v. Eurobox Ltd., WIPO Case No. D2007-1886. In this decision, the panel concluded that even if in the view of a panel the \u201cwrong\u201d respondent is identified in the heading of the complaint, it does not necessarily follow that the proceedings should be rejected as invalid as having been brought against the \u201cwrong\u201d person. Of course, the respective panel noted, if a complainant has misidentified whom it considers the person who in reality has control of the domain name, it may be that its arguments as to abuse are ill founded and will not prevail (see Mrs. Eva Padberg v. Eurobox Ltd., WIPO Case No. D2007-1886; for further references, see Body Accounting, Inc. v. Affinity Domains, Energy First, WIPO Case No. D2009-1419; RapidShare AG, Christian Schmid v. PrivacyAnywhere Software, LLC, Mikhail Berdnikov (Protected Domain Services Customer ID: DSR-2262893, Protected Domain Services Customer ID: DSR-2092987) and RapidShare AG, Christian Schmid v. Winsoul, Inc., Aleksey Atushev; (Protected Domain Services Customer ID: DSR-2239262), WIPO Case No. D2010-0894).\nFurthermore, the Panel notes that a very common way to determine the correct holder of the Domain Name is to check up the person or entity, which is recorded in the Registrar\u2019s register as revealed by a WhoIs search (see Mrs. Eva Padberg v. Eurobox Ltd., WIPO Case No. D2007-1886).\nBased on the evidence submitted by the parties, the relevant WhoIs search provides the following information:\n- Registrant Name: Federico Zecchetto\n- Registrant Organization: A.P.G. SRL\n- Registrant Street: Via Castelbelforte, 3/A\n- Registrant City: Bigarello\n- Registrant State/Province:\n- Registrant Postal Code: 46030\n- Registrant Country: IT\nConsidering all the above, the Panel finds that it thus appears that both entities \u201cRegistrant Name\u201d, Federico Zecchetto, and the \u201cRegistrant Organization\u201d, A.P.G. SRL, can be identified as relevant entities for the Domain Name registration, as confirmed by the Registrar. To put it differently, since the Registrar stated that Mr. Federico Zecchetto is the current registrant of the Domain Name and considering previous UDRP decisions, where it is stated that it does not necessarily follow that the proceedings should be rejected as invalid as having been brought against the \u201cwrong\u201d person (see Mrs. Eva Padberg v. Eurobox Ltd., WIPO Case No. D2007-1886), the Panel is of the view that the Complaint is admissible.\n7. Discussion and Findings\nThe Panel has thoroughly considered all of the evidence and arguments submitted by the parties, even if no specific or detailed reference has been made to those arguments in the following discussion on the merits.\nA. Preliminary remarks\nAs mentioned above, if a panel is of the view that a complainant has misidentified who it considers to be the person who in reality has control of the domain name, it may be that its arguments as to abuse are ill founded and will not prevail (see Mrs. Eva Padberg v. Eurobox Ltd., WIPO Case No. D2007-1886; for further references, see Body Accounting, Inc. v. Affinity Domains, Energy First, WIPO Case No. D2009-1419; RapidShare AG, Christian Schmid v. PrivacyAnywhere Software, LLC, Mikhail Berdnikov (Protected Domain Services Customer ID: DSR-2262893, Protected Domain Services Customer ID: DSR-2092987) and RapidShare AG, Christian Schmid v. Winsoul, Inc., Aleksey Atushev; (Protected Domain Services Customer ID: DSR-2239262), WIPO Case No. D2010-0894).\nAgainst this background, and taking in consideration on one side the confirmation of the Registrar and on the other side the undisputed controlling role of Mr. Zecchetto in A.P.G. SRL, it would amount to excessive formalism to strictly differentiate between the person mentioned under the \u201cRegistrant Name\u201d and the one indicated as the \u201cRegistrant Organization\u201d. What is relevant is if in relation to a holder of a disputed domain name the requirements for a transfer under the Policy are fulfilled or not. This is what the Panel will now analyze, referring, for sake of good reading, to Respondent and A.P.G. SRL as the \u201cDomain Name Holder\u201d.\nB. Requirements under paragraph 4(a) of the Policy\nIf the Complainant is to succeed, it must prove each of the three elements referred to in paragraph 4(a) of the Policy, namely that:\n(i) The Domain Name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark in which the Complainant has rights; and\n(ii) The Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the Domain Name; and\n(iii) The Domain Name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\na) Identical or Confusingly Similar\nIn its Response, the Domain Name Holder recognizes that the Domain Name is identical to the Trademark. In fact, the Panel acknowledges that the Domain Name is identical with the Complainant\u2019s trademarks.\nThus, the Panel finds that the Domain Name is identical or confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademarks pursuant to paragraph 4(a)(i) of the Policy.\nb) Rights or Legitimate Interests\nFrom the evidence in front of the Panel, the Domain Name Holder\u2019s name is not Giordana. However, the Domain Name Holder has rights in respect of the GIORDANA trademark in virtue of a license agreement signed on September 19, 1994 between the company Gita Sporting Goods Ltd. (owned by the Complainant) and the company A.P.G. SRL. Contrary to the Complainant\u2019s line of argumentation, the Panel is of the view that the agreement signed on September 7, 2013 did not remove all ties between A.P.G. SRL and the trademark. In particular, the agreement states that the distribution of the Giordana apparel was assigned to the company A.P.G. SRL until December 31, 2014 and the production of Giordana apparel is assigned to the company A.P.G. SRL until December 31, 2015.\nAt the time of the last renewal (i.e. December 2014), the Domain Name Holder was still assigned with a right to distribute the Giordana apparel. However, the use of the Domain Name at that time failed to meet the requirements set out in Oki Data Americas, Inc. v. ASD, Inc. WIPO Case No. D2001-0903, according to which a distributor can make a bona fide offering of goods and services and thus have legitimate interests in the Domain Name. To be bona fide, the offering must meet several requirements. In the case at hand, the Domain Name did not offer the goods bearing the GIORDANA trademark, nor did the Domain Name Holder use the site to sell only the trademarked goods. In addition, the Domain Name did not accurately disclose the registrant\u2019s relationship with the trademark owner. Since none of the above criteria are met, the Panel finds that the Domain Name Holder fails to pass the so-called Oki Data-test and thus the Domain Name Holder cannot claim rights or legitimate interests in the Domain Name deriving from a bona fide offering of goods and services.\nUp to date, the Domain Name Holder is assigned only the right to produce Giordana apparel. Moreover, by email dated January 8, 2015, the Domain Name Holder informed the Complainant that it would stop every kind of use and exploitation of the trademark, including its online usage. Based on these circumstances, the Panel cannot find any rights or legitimate interests in the Domain Name likewise.\nThe Panel notes that a reseller may have rights and legitimate interests in a domain name. However, the use of the Domain Name in this particular case fails to meet the requirements under the Oki Data-test and thus no rights or legitimate interests may be derived from a potential bona fide offering of goods and services. To the contrary, the Panel notes that the Domain Name Holder renewed the Domain Name registration in December 2013, which was shortly after it signed the agreement, according to which the Complainant withdrew from the company A.P.G. SRL. Soon afterwards, an automatic redirection was set up, redirecting Internet visitors from the Domain Name to the Domain Name Holder\u2019s competitive website \u201cwww.apgcycling.com\u201d. This in the Panel\u2019s view is not a good faith use of the Disputed Domain Name. In particular, this becomes evident after the Domain Name Holder informed the Complainant by email dated January 8, 2015 that it would stop every kind of use and exploitation of the trademark, including its online usage. Therefore, the Complainant succeeds in establishing the second requirement of paragraph 4(a) of the Policy (see Amoena Medizin-Orthop\u00e4die-Technik GmbH v. Amoena de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., a/k/a Ortopedia Ortiz, a/k/a 3wLeon, Guadalupe De La Luz Garcia Bravo, WIPO Case No. D2012-1144).\nc) Registered and Used in Bad Faith\nThe Policy requires a complainant to prove both registration and use in bad faith.\nParagraph 4(b) of the Policy lists a number of circumstances, which, without limitation, are deemed to be evidence of the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith. Those circumstances are:\n(i) Circumstances indicating that [the Domain Name Holder has] registered or acquired the domain name primarily for purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration in excess of [the Domain Name Holder's] documented out-of-pocket costs directly to the domain name; or\n(ii) [the Domain Name Holder has] registered the domain name in order to prevent the owner of the trademark or service from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, provided that [the Domain Name Holder has] engaged in a pattern of such conduct; or\n(iii) [the Domain Name Holder has] registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or\n(iv) by using the domain name, [the Domain Name Holder has] intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to [the Domain Name Holder\u2019s] website or other on-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the Complainant\u2019s mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of [the Domain Name Holder\u2019s] website or location or of a product or service on [the Domain Name Holder\u2019s] website or location.\nThe Panel notes that the Domain Name has been registered on December 30, 1999 with the authorization of the Complainant and in virtue of a valid license agreement signed on September 19, 1994. In addition, the Panel is of the view that since 1999, no change of ownership of the Domain Name took place.\nIn the view of the Panel, registration and use of the Domain Name must each be proven (see Validas, LLC v. SMVS Consultancy Private Limited, WIPOCase No. D2009-1413; Camon S.p.A. v. Intelli-Pet, LLC, WIPO Case No. D2009-1716; Atlas Productions, LLC v. Oneandone Private Registrant / Phil McCarty, WIPO Case No. D2011-0519). In other words, the plain literal meaning of the third element of the Policy is that both registration and use in bad faith must be found individually before the requirements of that element are fulfilled (see Guru Denim Inc. v. Ibrahim Ali Ibrahim Abu-Harb, WIPO Case No. D2013-1324).\nBoth parties agree that the Domain Name was not registered in bad faith in 1999. Thus, according to the evidence submitted, the Panel finds that the Domain Name was originally registered in good faith.\nThe question, however, remains whether the renewal of the Domain Name in 2013 and 2014, respectively, may be considered as a (new) registration in bad faith.\nParagraph 3.7 of the WIPO Overview 2.0 makes clear that a mere renewal of a domain name has not generally been treated as a new registration for the purpose of assessing bad faith. Registration in bad faith must normally occur at the time the current registrant took possession of the domain name. Panels have tended to the view that formal changes in registration data are not necessarily deemed to constitute a new registration where evidence clearly establishes an unbroken chain of underlying ownership by a single entity or within a genuine conglomerate, and it is clear that any change in WhoIs registrant data is not being made to conceal an underlying owner\u2019s identity for the purpose of frustrating assessment of liability in relation to registration or use of the domain name.\nThis Panel is of the view that the construction of \u201cregistration\u201d as a continuous process would negate the distinction between \u201cregistration\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d within the Policy. The objective of the Policy was basically to combat the undue and abusive registration of domain names in \u201ccybersquatting\u201d cases (see Poundland Limited v. Dealz.com, WIPO Case No. D2012-0918; see also Xbridge Limited v. Marchex Sales, Inc, WIPO Case No. D2010-2069; Side by Side, Inc. /dba/ Sidetrack v. Alexander Lerman, WIPO Case No. D2012-0771). Thus, the Panel concludes that according to the evidence provided, the Domain Name was not registered in bad faith in 1999 and additionally, the renewal of the Domain Name in 2013 and 2014 cannot be considered as a registration under paragraph 4(a)(iii) of the Policy. Therefore, the Complainant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the Respondent registered the Domain Name in bad faith.\nAccordingly, the Panel finds that the Complainant has failed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 4(a)(iii) of the Policy and, therefore, the Complaint must be denied.\nThe fact that the Complaint is denied shall not be interpreted as an entitlement of the Respondent to use the Domain Name in bad faith. However, whether the Complainant has any right, of contractual or other nature, to compel the Respondent to the transfer of the Doman Name or to limit its use, is not a matter that can be decided by the Panel within the framework of this procedure.\n8. Decision\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Complaint is denied.\nMichael A.R. Bernasconi": [

"Macedonia, Montenegro, Morocco, Norway, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Singapore, Sudan, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and Viet Nam.\n- Turkish Trade Mark No. 2008 20994, FACEBOOK, registered on 10 March 2009.\nThe Complainant is also the owner of numerous domain names consisting of or including the FACEBOOK trade mark under various generic Top-Level Domains as well as under various country code Top-Level Domains.\nThe Complainant was alerted to the fact that its FACEBOOK trade mark and company name had been registered with the addition of the descriptive term \u201cpartner\u201d under the \u201c.com\u201d generic Top-Level Domain (\u201cgTLD\u201d) by the Respondent on August 30, 2010. The Respondent appears to be the managing partner of three Turkish marketing and media companies, trading under the names \u201cAlafortanfoni\u201d, \u201cAbnormal Media\u201d and \u201cWhatTheFun\u201d. Until 2011, the Respondent also appears to have been the registrant of the domain names <facebookpartner.net> and <facebookpartner.info>.\nThe Complainant says that, at the time of filing this Complaint, the disputed domain name does not resolve to an active website. Screen captures from searches carried out on Archive.org show that in February 2011, the disputed domain name temporarily resolved to a GoDaddy parking page displaying pay-per-click links. The disputed domain name does not otherwise appear to have been associated with any active website.\nOn October 12, 2018, the Complainant\u2019s lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter by registered post and email asking the Respondent to transfer the disputed domain name to the Complainant. On November 7, 2018, they sent a reminder to the Respondent. Despite the Complainant\u2019s efforts to contact the Respondent, no reply has been received.\nThe Complainant\u2019s contentions are that:\na) The disputed domain name is confusingly similar to a trade mark in which the Complainant has rights;\nb) The Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name;\nc) The disputed domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith.\nThe Complainant seeks the transfer of the disputed domain names to itself.\nB.

"S\u00e3o Paulo, Santiago, Seoul, Shanghai (Greater Chinese headquarters), and Toronto.\n\nThe Complainant is the owner of many international and national trademarks for UNDER ARMOUR with the oldest registration since 1999.\n\nThe Complainant became sponsor of famous athletes, the Complainant\u2019s products have been shown in movie \u201cAny Given Sunday (1999) and the Complainant lunched its first-ever TV campaign in 2000 and lately it became the official supplier of the National Hockey League. At the end of the first decade of 2000, the Complainant surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue. On November 18, 2005, Under Armour went public, trading at NASDAQ under \u201cUARM\u201d and became the first U.S.-based initial public offering in five years to double on its first day of trading. The following year the footwear business was started in 2006 through the introduction of its first line of football cleats and the brand UNDER ARMOUR captured a 23% share of the market in just the first year.\n\nOver the years, the Complainant has made significant strides in establishing a strong presence outside of the US; through on-field partnerships with elite professional teams and players, the brand gained enormous traction with athletes in Japan, Europe, Canada, Latin America. The Complainant is widely known as one of the largest sportswear brands in the U.S. also for its partnership with NBA athlete Stephen Curry.\n\nTherefore, the Complainant has spent considerable effort in promoting this mark, thereby acquiring the trademark\u2019s goodwill.\n\nThe Complainant registered several domain names consisting of or comprising the trademark UNDER ARMOUR under several different TLDs, including <underarmour.com>, which was registered on June 2, 1997, <underarmour.asia>, registered on November 27, 2007, <underarmour.cn>, registered on 16 November 2005. The Complainant\u2019s websites and Social Media accounts generate a significant number of visits by Internet users every day and are used by the Complainant to promote and also sell online its products. Complainant\u2019s Facebook account has more than ten million followers.\n\nThe disputed domain names were registered by the Respondent, without authorization of Complainant, in 2019 in the name of a privacy shield and have been pointed to websites publishing the UNDER ARMOUR trademarks and promoting and selling purported products of the Complainant.\n\nAs soon as the Complainant became aware of the Respondent\u2019s registration and use of the disputed domain names, confusingly similar to its registered and well-known trademark UNDER ARMOUR, it instructed its representative to address to the owner of the disputed domain names cease and desist letters in order to notify them of the infringement of the Complainant\u2019s trademark rights, requesting the immediate cease of any use, and the transfer, of the disputed domain names to the Complainant. Cease and desist letters were sent by email, on June 16, 2020, to the disputed domain names owner\u2019s known email addresses indicated at that time in the WHOIS record but the owner did not deem appropriate to answer.\n\nA. The domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the Complainant has rights\n\nThe disputed domain names are confusingly similar to trademarks in which Complainant has rights, as per copies of trademark registrations provided. The disputed domain names incorporate the whole of the Complainant\u2019s trademark UNDER ARMOUR and the fact that they include non-distinctive elements, such as geographical indicator \u201cbudapest\u201d and the generic word \u201cwinkel\u201d (\u201cshop\u201d in Dutch language), with the Top-Level Domain .com does not affect the confusing similarity.\n\nIt is a well-established principle that domain names that wholly incorporate trademarks, in particular ones as famous UNDER ARMOUR, are found to be confusingly similar for the purposes of the Policy, despite the fact that the disputed domain names may also contain descriptive or generic terms.\n\nIt should be also noted that the geographical indication \u201cbudapest\u201d and the generic Dutch term \u201cwinkel\u201d, encompassed in the disputed domain names, while cannot be considered enough to distinguish disputed domain names from the Complainant\u2019s mark, are all the more apt to induce confusion among Internet users. UNDER ARMOUR is, in fact, internationally well-known marks in the sector of sport, and the Complainant\u2019s products are sold worldwide.\n\nFurthermore, the top level \u201c.com\u201d is merely instrumental to the use in Internet and not able to affect the confusing similarity of the disputed domain names to the Complainant\u2019s trademark.\n\nIn light of the above, the disputed domain names are certainly confusingly similar to the prior registered trademarks in which the Complainant has rights pursuant to paragraph 4(a)(i) of the Policy.\n\nB. The Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name(s)\n\nAccording to paragraph 4(a) of the Policy, the burden of proving the absence of the Respondent\u2019s rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain names lies with the Complainant. It is nevertheless a well-settled principle that satisfying this burden is unduly onerous, since proving a negative fact is logically less feasible than establishing a positive. Accordingly, it is enough for the Complainant to produce prima facie evidence in order to shift the burden of production to the Respondent.\n\nAs a preliminary note, the mere registration of a domain name does not establish rights or legitimate interests in a disputed domain name.\n\nThe Respondent is not licensee, authorized agent of the Complainant or in any other way authorized to use Complainant\u2019s trademarks. Specifically, the Respondent is not authorized reseller of the Complainant and has not been authorized to register and use the disputed domain names.\n\nUpon information and belief, the Respondent is not commonly known by the disputed domain names as individuals, business or other organization and their family names do not correspond to UNDER ARMOUR or the disputed domain names.\n\nThe Respondent has not provided the Complainant with any evidence of the use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the disputed domain names in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services before any notice of the dispute.\n\nThe disputed domain names have been redirected by the Respondent to websites where the Complainant\u2019s trademarks UNDER ARMOUR are published and prima facie counterfeit UNDER ARMOUR branded products are offered for sale. Moreover, there is no evident disclaimer as to the Respondent\u2019s lack of relationship with the Complainant.\n\nIt is apparent that the Respondent's use can be considered neither a bona fide offering of goods or services nor a legitimate non-commercial or fair use of the disputed domain names. Such willful conduct clearly demonstrates, to the contrary, that Respondent did not intend to use the disputed domain names in connection with any legitimate purpose.\n\nFurthermore, such use of the disputed domain names cannot be considered a legitimate non-commercial or fair use without intent for commercial gain, because the Respondent is undoubtedly attempting to gain from the sales of prima facie counterfeit products and it is clear that the Respondent\u2019s intention is to benefit from the Complainant\u2019s trademarks\u2019 reputation to disrupt the Complainant\u2019s business and to illegitimately trade on the Complainant\u2019s fame for commercial gain.\n\nIn the Case No. D2015-1466 WIPO Prada S.A. v. Chen Mingjie, where a counterparty of the Complainant was using its web site to offer for sale prima facie counterfeit PRADA products at prices significantly lower than those of the original products and published no disclaimer, the Panel found: \u201cGiven the high probability that the goods on offer through the disputed domain name are counterfeit, and the lack of disclosure on the site as to the Respondent's lack of relationship to the Complainant, there is also no evidence of a bona fide offering of goods or services\u201d.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Complainant concludes that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain names pursuant to paragraph 4(a)(ii) of the Policy.\n\nC. The domain name(s) was/were registered and is/are being used in bad faith.\n\nAs to the assessment of the Respondent\u2019s bad faith at the time of registration, in light of the registration and intensive use of the trademark UNDER ARMOUR since 1999, the advertising and sales of the Complainant\u2019s products worldwide, the Respondent could not have possibly ignored the existence of the Complainant\u2019s trademark, confusingly similar to the disputed domain names.\n\nThe aforesaid trademark of the Complainant enjoys worldwide reputation in the sector of manufacturing footwear, sports and casual apparel. The disputed domain names were registered in 2019, years after the Complainant obtained its trademark registrations.\n\nFurthermore, the actual knowledge of UNDER ARMOUR trademarks by the Respondent at the time of the registration of the disputed domain names is demonstrated by the facts that the Respondent offers for sale replicas of Complainant\u2019s apparel and that the Respondent reproduces also the trademarks UNDER ARMOUR on the web sites corresponding to the disputed domain names.\n\nBy virtue of its extensive worldwide use, the Complainant\u2019s trademark UNDER ARMOUR has become a well-known trademark in the sector of manufacturing footwear, sports and casual apparel. Considering the trademark\u2019s distinctiveness and well-known character, it is inconceivable that the Respondent was unaware of the existence of the Complainant\u2019s registered trademark at the time of the registration of the disputed domain names, with which it is confusingly similar.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the Respondent was well aware of the trademark UNDER ARMOUR and registered the disputed domain names with the intention to refer to the Complainant and its trademarks.\n\nWith reference to the above, the Complainant highlights that it has been stated in various decisions that the registration of a domain name with the knowledge of the complainant\u2019s trademark is an evidence of bad faith.\n\nIndeed, the fact that replicas of UNDER ARMOUR shoes have been offered for sale on the web sites corresponding to the disputed domain names indicates that the Respondent was fully aware of the Complainant\u2019s mark\u2019s reputation and association with the Complainant and that his purpose in registering the disputed domain names was solely to capitalize on the reputation of Complainant's mark by diverting Internet users seeking products under the UNDER ARMOUR mark to its own commercial web sites.\n\nAs highlighted in Swarovski Aktiengesellschaft v. Jun Qiao, WIPO Case No. D2013-1617, \u201cthe fact that purported Swarovski goods were offered at the relevant website indicates that the Respondent was fully aware of the Swarovski mark\u2019s distinct reputation and association with the Complainant. There is no reason to choose such a distinctive mark, and also to include other terms in a domain name that are suggestive of the very business of the Complainant, other than a bad faith attempt to ride on the coattails of the trademark owner\u201d.\n\nThe use of the disputed domain names in connection with commercial web sites where the Complainant\u2019s trademark is misappropriated and prima facie counterfeit UNDER ARMOUR branded shoes are offered for sale, clearly indicates that the Respondents\u2019 purpose in registering the disputed domain names was to capitalize on the reputation of the Complainant's trademark by diverting Internet users seeking UNDER ARMOUR products to their websites for financial gain, by intentionally creating a likelihood of confusion with the Complainant's trademarks as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of its web sites and/or the goods offered or promoted through said web sites.\n\nSuch use of the disputed domain names to promote and sell prima facie counterfeit products is also apt to disrupt Complainant's business. Moreover, on the web sites corresponding to the disputed domain names there is no disclaimer informing the users as to the Respondents\u2019 lack of relationship with the Complainant thus, the websites create the impression that they are authorized by the Complainant.\n\nAs anticipated, in light of the low prices, the shoes offered for sale on the web site corresponding to the disputed domain names are prima facie counterfeit products and such conduct constitutes a further evidence of bad faith registration and use of the disputed domain names, as stated in several decisions.\n\nAs an additional circumstance demonstrating bad faith, prior Panels have also held that a failure to respond to a cease-and-desist letter can be evidence of bad faith.\n\nIn light of the above, the Complainant respectfully submits that the Domain Names were registered and are being used in bad faith in full satisfaction of paragraphs 4(a)(iii)": [

Procedural History\nThe procedures for resolving Complaints like this one are governed by the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (hereafter \"The Policy\") adopted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\"ICANN\") on August 26, 1999, ICANN\u2019s Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (hereafter \"The Rules\"), as well as the Supplemental Rules of the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center (hereafter \"The Supplemental Rules\").\nThe current dispute lies within the scope of the Policy, so that the Center does have proper jurisdiction to hear and decide this dispute. The terms and conditions of the registration agreement between Registrar NSI and the Respondents clearly incorporate the Policy, so that Respondents were notified of the existence of the Policy\u2019s provisions for domain name dispute resolution. The Policy contains in its Paragraph 4(a) the elements to be pleaded in order for a mandatory administrative proceeding such as this one to be held: Complainant must allege that (i) Respondent\u2019s domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the Complainant has rights; that (ii) Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the domain name; and that (iii) Respondent\u2019s domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith. See the Policy, Paragraph 4 (a). In order to successfully make its case, the Complainant must prove each of these three elements.\nAn electronic copy of the complaint was filed on March 22, 2001": [

See Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. v. The Car Openers Inc., FA 233077 (Nat. Arb. Forum Dec. 31, 2008)(Complainant\u2019s LEXUS registrations with the USPTO held to constitute sufficient evidence of Complainant\u2019s rights in the mark under Policy\n\u00b64(a)(i)).  See also Microsoft Corp. v. Burkes, FA 652743 (Nat. Arb. Forum Apr. 17, 2006) (\u201cComplainant has established rights in the MICROSOFT mark through registration of the mark with the USPTO.\u201d); Morgan Stanley v. Fitz-James, FA 571918 (Nat. Arb. Forum Nov. 29, 2005) (finding from a preponderance of the evidence that the complainant had registered its mark with national trademark authorities, the Panel determined that \u201csuch registrations present a prima facie case of Complainant\u2019s rights in the mark for purposes of Policy \u00b64(a)(i).\u201d).   \n  When a party without rights to a trademark incorporates that trademark in its entirety into a domain name, that is sufficient to establish that the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a complainant\u2019s registered mark.  See Trip.com, Inc. v. Daniel Deamone, WIPO Case No. D2001-1066 (Nov. 4, 2001)(\u201cthe incorporation of a trademark in its entirety is sufficient to establish that a domain name is identical or confusingly similar to the complainant\u2019s registered mark>\u201d); see also Berlitz Investment Corporation v. Katelin Adkins, WIPO Case No. D2007-0008 (March 13, 2007).\n  Further, the Domain Names consist of the INFINITI trademark plus the geographical indicator \u201cTallahassee\u201d and \u201cof Tallahassee.\u201d It  is well-established  that  domain  names  that consist of a trademark plus a geographical location are confusingly similar to the trademark at issue. See, e.g., Rolls-Royce PLC v. Hallofpain, WIPO Case No. D2000-1709 (Feb. 19, 2001) (\u201cThe addition of the name of a place to a trade mark, such as the addition of the word \"Canada\" to \"ROLLSROYCE\", is a common method for specifying the location of business services provided under the trade mark. The addition of the geographical location to a trade mark does not prevent the domain name from being confusingly similar to the trade mark.\u201d); Volvo Trademark Holding AB v. SC-RAD Inc., WIPO Case No. D2003-0601 (Oct. 9, 2003)(\u201cThe domain name registered by the Respondent <volvopolska.com> is identical to and confusingly similar  to  the  Complainant\u2019s  registered  trademark  \"VOLVO,\"  to  which  a  generic  top-level domain name \".com\" and a geographically descriptive term for services, \"polska\" (which means Poland in Polish) have been added. It has previously been held in very many other proceedings before WIPO Panelists that a domain name created by appending a geographic term to another\u2019s trademark or service mark does not change the domain name from being confusing similar to the trademark.\u201d), and Audi AG, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. v. Sandlot LLC, Jim Gossett, WIPO  Case  No.  D2008-1053  (Sep.  3,  2008)  (in  a  case  involving  the  domain  names <auditulsa.com> and <tulsaaudi.com>, the panel noted: \u201cThe addition of such a descriptive term is not sufficient to avoid a finding of confusing similarity, particularly in view of evidence that AUDI dealerships incorporate the name of the city in which it is located in its name.\u201d); Toyota Motor Sales USA v. Rafi Hamid dba ABC Automobile Buyer, WIPO Case No. D2001-0032 (March 28, 2001)(\u201cAdministrative panels and arbitrators considering similar cases where registrants simply added a geographical name to a registered trademark have found such domain names to be confusingly similar.)\u201d; Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. Abraham Dones, FA 874857  (Nat.  Arb.  Forum  Feb.  20,  2007)(\u201cThe  disputed  domain  name  that  Respondent registered, <toyotaofclermont.com>, contains Complainant\u2019s TOYOTA mark in its entirety and adds the geographical designation \u201cof Clermont\u201d as well as the generic top-level domain \u201c.com.\u201d The addition of a geographical designation does not avoid a finding of confusing similarity under Policy \u00b64(a)(i), and the addition of the generic top-level domain \u201c.com\u201d is without significance to this analysis.  Therefore, the Panel finds that the disputed domain name, <toyotaofclermont.com>, is confusingly similar to Complainant\u2019s TOYOTA mark pursuant to Policy \u00b64(a)(i).\u201d).\n  Finally, as also indicated in Toyota v. Dones, FA 874857, above, the addition of the top level domain <.com> does not add any distinctiveness to the domain names and is irrelevant in the evaluation of whether a domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark.  See also Nevada State Bank v. Modern Ltd.-Cayman Web Dev., FA 204063 (Nat. Arb. Forum Dec. 6, 2003)(\u201cIt has been established that the addition of a generic top-level domain is irrelevant when considering whether a domain name is identical or confusingly similar under the Policy.\u201d).\n  In this case, the misleading nature of the Domain Names in question make the Panel\u2019s decision an easy one.  Complainant has used the INFINITI trademark for over 20 years.  The Trademark has been long registered with the USPTO, and such registrations are valid and incontestable.  Accordingly, Complainant has rights to the INFINITI trademark.\n  The disputed Domain Names are confusingly similar to Complainant\u2019s well-known INFINITI trademark because Respondent\u2019s Domain Names incorporate the INFINITI trademark in its entirety and add the geographical location \u201cTallahassee.\u201d  Indeed, in this circumstance, the Domain Names are identical (in the case of <infinitioftallahassee.com>) and confusingly similar (in the case of <tallahasseeinfiniti.com) to the name of the Infiniti dealer authorized and licensed by Nissan to exercise its business in Tallahassee.\n  [b.]       Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the Domain\nNames that are the subject of the complaint.\n  Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests to the Domain Names that are the subject of this Complaint.  In making its decision, the Panel may consider any relevant information, including but not limited to ICANN Policy \u00b64(c), which seeks to determine:\n(i) [w]hether, before any notice to the Respondent of the dispute, Respondent\u2019s use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the domain name or a name  corresponding  to the domain name is in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services;\n  (ii) [w]hether Respondent (as an individual, business, or other organization) has been commonly known by the domain name, even if Respondent has not acquired trademark or service mark rights; or\n  (iii) [w]hether Respondent is making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name, without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue.\n  Here, each of these factors requires a decision in favor of Complainant.\n  First of all, under United States trademark law, a valid and subsisting trademark registration \u201cshall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of the registrant\u2019s ownership of the mark, and of the registrant\u2019s exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services specified in the certificate\u2026\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a71057(b) (emphasis added).  Complainant has prior and exclusive rights in the Trademark, having first begun use of the Trademark in the United States, and having registered the Trademark with the USPTO, long before Respondent\u2019s initial registration of the disputed Domain Names with the Registrar on June 2, 2011.\n  Second, Respondent has never been commonly known as \u201cINFINITI\u201d or by the Domain Names.  Respondent was never licensed or otherwise permitted or authorized by Nissan in any way to use the INFINITI trademark in his Domain Names, on his websites or in any other manner. The WhoIs information identifies the Registrant of the Domain Names as Peter Kraft, which indicates that neither Respondent nor his business is commonly known by the Domain Names.  See  Central  Valley  Automotive  d/b/a  Central  Valley  Hyundai  v.  Chris  Shaffer, FA327840 (Nat. Arb. Forum July 22, 2010)(\u201cThe Panel finds that the WHOIS information for the disputed domain name identifies \u201cChris Shaffer\u201d as the registrant of the domain name. Therefore, the Panel finds that Respondent is not commonly known by the disputed domain name under Policy \u00b64(c)(ii).\u201d); G.D. Searle & Co. v. Celebrex Drugstore, FA 123933 (Nat. Arb. Forum Nov. 21, 2002)(finding no rights or legitimate interests where respondent was not commonly known by the mark and did not have a license or permission from the complainant to use the trademarked name).\n  Respondent is co-owner of Kraft Nissan, a Nissan dealership in Tallahassee. Having a Nissan dealership, however, does not authorize Respondent to use the INFINITI brand. The license provided to Nissan dealers does not confer any rights to Complainant\u2019s other brands, including the INFINITI brand. Rather, Respondent has intentionally registered the disputed Domain Names with full knowledge of Complainant\u2019s rights, in the hope of becoming an Infiniti dealer. However, at the time he registered the Domain Names (on June 2, 2011), Respondent had been granted no rights to use the INFINITI brand and therefore it had no rights to register the Domain Names.\nAlso, Respondent\u2019s use of the Domain Names or of names corresponding to the Domain Names is not in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services, nor is Respondent making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the Domain Names.  The Domain Names resolve to websites that display links for automotive businesses as well as unrelated services.   Panels have consistently held that such use is not a bona fide offering of goods or services pursuant to Policy \u00b64(c)(i), or a legitimate noncommercial or fair use pursuant to Policy \u00b64(c)(iii).  See Toyota of Des Moines v. Domain Administrator, FA 1244539 (Nat. Arb. Forum March 24, 2009); Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. Abraham Dones, FA 874857 (Nat. Arb. Forum Feb. 20, 2007).\n  In conclusion, Respondent has no right or legitimate interest in the Domains Names. Indeed, these Domain Names now correspond to the name of the authorized Infiniti dealer in Tallahassee, and any use by Respondent would mislead the public into believing that the corresponding  websites  are  owned  by  the  authorized  Infiniti  dealer  or  that  Respondent  is affiliated to Complainant or to the authorized dealer.\n  [c.]       The Domain Names were registered and are used in bad faith.\n  Respondent registered the Domain Names in bad faith, because, at the time of registration, the INFINITI trademark was well-known, and Respondent had actual knowledge of Complainant\u2019s trademark rights: Respondent owned an authorized Nissan dealership and was, in fact, attempting to purchase an Infiniti dealership. Actual or constructive knowledge of a party\u2019s trademark rights is a factor establishing bad faith. Playboy Enters. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Tamara Pitts, WIPO Case No. D2006-0675 Aug. 3, 2006) (\u201c\u2026 Respondent\u2019s registration of a Domain Name incorporating a very famous mark of which she was clearly aware, without any evident right to do so, can itself be taken as evidence of bad faith.\u201d).\n  Respondent decided to register the Domain Names prior to submitting to Complainant the bid for the Infiniti dealership in Tallahassee, with the intent of preventing any other party from registering the Domain Names.  At the time of registering the Domain Names, Respondent knew that the name of the new Infiniti dealer would be in the form of either Domain Name, as it is preferred naming structure to use the brand name and the geographical location of the dealer\u2019s territory.2 However, since, at the time of registration, Respondent had no license to use the INFINITI trademark; had not been awarded an Infiniti dealership in Tallahassee; and had no reason to believe that it might be the winner of the bid, Registrant had no authority to register the Domain Names.\n  Furthermore, it has been consistently found that, when a domain resolves to a website that displays links to other websites, including competitors\u2019 websites, such use of the domain is evidence of bad faith registration.  See, e.g., Toyota of Des Moines v. Domain Administrator, FA 1244539 (Nat. Arb. Forum March 24, 2009); Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. v. Abraham Dones, FA 874857 (Nat. Arb. Forum Feb. 20, 2007)(\u201cRespondent has caused the disputed domain name that contains in its entirety Complainant\u2019s protected mark to display a list of links that lead Internet users seeking Complainant to websites of Complainant\u2019s competitors. This is likely to disrupt Complainant\u2019s business by diverting business away from Complainant.\n  2 Please refer to footnote no. 1 and related discussion.\nTherefore, the Panel finds that Respondent\u2019s use of the disputed domain name constitutes bad faith registration and use pursuant to Policy \u00b64(b)(iii).\u201d).\n  Finally, Respondent registered not one, but two domain names, which is further evidence of bad faith registration.   See, e.g., American Honda Motor Co., Inc. v. Michell Huddleston, WIPO  Case  No.  D2011-0076  (Apr.  1,  2011)  (\u201c\u2026the  fact  that  Respondent  registered  two domains that are confusingly similar to a trademark in which Complainant has rights [in this case, <hondaofgainesville.com> and <hondaofgainesville.net>] adds to the evidence of bad faith.\u201d).\n  After the bid was concluded and Respondent was told that he had not won, Respondent did not relinquish the Domain Names.   Instead, when asked by the new dealer to sell it the Domain Names, Respondent demanded $50,000.  Respondent\u2019s excuse to sell at a price way beyond out-of-pocket costs was that it had incurred due diligence costs and expenses in association with its bid.  However, the purchase of the Domain Names was but a minuscule fraction of that amount, and the costs related to the bid are irrelevant, because UDRP Policy \u00b64(b)(i) clearly refers to \u201cdocumented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain name\u201d.\n  In The South African Football Association (SAFA) v. Fairfield Tours (Pty) Ltd, WIPO Case No. D2009-0998 (Sep. 11, 2009), the respondent was found to have offered to sell the domain for an excessive amount when it tried to include costs such as attorneys\u2019 fees associated with registering related companies, attorneys\u2019 fees for trademark work, and auditors, for a grant total of $45,000. The Panel noted: \u201cWhen the items set out in the computation of the claim are examined, they go far beyond the registration and maintenance of the Domain Name and include a variety of other costs incurred.\u201d  See also EMI Records Limited v. Complete Axxxcess, WIPO Case No. D2001-1230 (Dec. 18, 2001) (\u201cThe consideration by the Respondent was obviously more than any out-of-pocket costs that the Respondent might have incurred directly related to the domain name in dispute.\u201d (Emphasis added)). In CBS Broadcasting, Inc. v. Gaddoor Saidi, WIPO Case No. D2000-0243 (June 2, 2000), the Panel found that the respondent\u2019s offer to sell the domain name for a \u201cminimum total\u201d of $114,000, which included his \u201closs of opportunity to use the disputed domain name\u201d in his venture, was in excess of his out of pocket costs, and that, \u201c[u]nder the Policy, an offer to sell the domain name for valuable consideration in excess of the documented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain name is not only evidence of, but conclusively establishes that, the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\u201d (Emphasis added).\n  In Toyota Motor Sales USA v. Rafi Hamid dba ABC Automobile Buyer, WIPO Case No. D2001-0032 (March 28, 2001), the panel found that the respondent had worked at several of complainant\u2019s dealerships and had actual knowledge of the LEXUS trademark and its strength at the time it registered the domains. The panel stated:\n  The significant goodwill and value of the mark LEXUS is understood by Respondent. Given the fame of the mark LEXUS, it is clear that Respondent registered the Domain Names with full knowledge of Complainant\u2019s rights in the trademark and service mark LEXUS . . . [] Respondent\u2019s conduct prevents Complainant and its authorized dealers from promoting its own products and services and prevents Complainant from using these domain names. [] The result is that Internet traffic intended for Complainant or its authorized dealers can be diverted to Respondent. Respondent\u2019s use of the Domain Names creates a likelihood of confusion with Complainant\u2019s marks. Since Respondent is not licensed to use the mark LEXUS in this manner, Complainant is harmed because Toyota\u2019s valuable trademarks and reputation are being placed into the hands of Respondent over which Complainant has no control. The public is harmed because it is likely to be confused as to the source of the goods and services that may be offered at sites operated under the Domain Names.\n  Similarly here, Respondent understands the significant goodwill and value of the INFINITI brand; Respondent registered the Domain Names with full knowledge of Complainant\u2019s trademark rights; Respondent\u2019s conduct prevents Complainant\u2019s authorized Infiniti dealer from promoting its own products and services, thereby disrupting its business; and any use of the Domain Names will divert Internet traffic intended for Complainant\u2019s authorized Infiniti dealer, thereby creating a likelihood of confusion. This is especially true given the fact that Respondent is a Nissan dealer, as this is likely to confuse the public into the mistaken belief that this dealer has been awarded the new Infiniti dealership, as well.\n  The fact that the Domain Names currently resolve to websites that display links to third party websites does not eliminate the likely confusion and the tarnishment of the INFINITI brand, because the inability of customers to reach the website of the authorized Infiniti dealer in Tallahassee will create an unsatisfactory purchasing experience that will inevitably be associated with Complainant. See Toyota Motor Sales USA v. Rafi Hamid dba ABC Automobile Buyer, WIPO Case No. D2001-0032 (March 28, 2001) (\u201cNone of the Domain Names registered by Respondent resolve to active sites; accordingly, Complainant\u2019s customers are likely to be frustrated in their efforts to reach Complainant\u2019s website and the website of Complainant\u2019s authorized dealers.\u201d).   See also Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. Inc., Gulf States Toyota, Inc. and Price Leblanc, Inc. dba Price Leblanc Toyota v. Gulf South Limited, WIPO Case No. D2001-0698 (July 25, 2001) (\u201cThe Complainants assert the Respondent registered the disputed domain names in bad faith because it has made no use whatever of the domain names. The Panel finds this argument persuasive and notes that other ICANN Panels have found bad faith where a party has passively \"warehoused\" a domain name fully aware the name contained another party's (in this case famous) trademark.\u201d).\n  In view of all of the above, it is without question that the Domain Names were registered and are being used in bad faith by Respondent.\n  B.

Cyprus, Ukraine, Uruguay, Venezuela, Vietnam, Yugoslavia and Zaire.\nMany of the registrations date from 1973.\n4.3.4 Use, promotion and status of the Complainant's EUROCARD Marks\nThe Complainant asserts that, by reason of its extensive use and promotion, the EUROCARD mark symbolises very significant goodwill identified with the Complainant and that the mark is one of incalculable value. The Complainant further asserts that due to the fame and registration of the EUROCARD marks the Respondents have constructive knowledge of those marks. The Complainant refers to WIPO Case D2000-0173 in which the Panel found that the EUROCARD mark was famous at the time when the domain names in issue in that case were registered.\nFor the purposes of this Complaint, the Panel finds that the EUROCARD mark is exceptionally well known and that it is inconceivable that the Respondents did not have actual knowledge that in registering the domain name in issue they were infringing the Complainant's EUROCARD marks.\n4.4 Disputed Facts\nIn the absence of a Response, there is no challenge to the facts and evidence asserted by the Complainant. The Panel finds that the evidence presented by the Complainant is admissible, relevant, material and convincing.\n  5. Parties' Contentions\nA. The Complainant\nThe Complainant contends that the Respondents have registered as a domain name a mark which is identical to or confusingly similar to the Complainant's EUROCARD: EUROCARD E; and E EUROCARD marks, that the Respondents have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of that domain name and the Respondents have registered and are using that domain name in bad faith.\nB.

"Darren, Angela, Jonathan, Michell, Oiu, Matthew, Pamela, Selima, Angela, John, Sally, Susanna, WIPO Case No. D2010-0988.\nThe ALDI element is still immediately recognizable as the Complainant\u2019s trademark. In the Panel\u2019s view, the addition of a descriptive term does not mitigate the likelihood of confusion between the Disputed Domain Name and the Complainant\u2019s ALDI trademark.\nAccordingly, the Panel finds that the Disputed Domain Name is identical o confusingly similar to marks in which Complainant has rights.\nThe Complainant therefore has satisfied paragraph 4(a)(i) of the Policy.\nB. Rights or Legitimate Interests\nThe Complainants have provided evidence that they did not license or otherwise authorize the Respondent to use their trademarks ALDI. Also, the Respondent does not appear to be commonly known by the Disputed Domain Name and it is evidently not making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of it.\nThe Complainants have established a prima facie case of lack of rights and legitimate interests and there has been no rebuttal from the Respondent. Nothing in the case file gives reason to believe that the Respondent has any rights or legitimate interests in respect of the Disputed Domain Name.\nThe Panel concludes that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the Disputed Domain Name in accordance with paragraph 4(c)(i) of the UDRP.\nC. Registered and Used in Bad Faith\nBased on the evidence submitted by the Complainant, the Panel accepts that the ALDI trademark is well-known.\nAs held by other panels, \u201cthe Complainant\u2019s ALDI trademark is very well-known. The Complainant operates thousands of supermarkets under that business name and trademark. The term \u201caldi\u201d has no inherent meaning and is very distinctive. The reputation of the mark is not limited to one country but is widespread in Europe and also in the US and in Australia.\u201d (See ALDI GmbH & Co. KG v. bestview GmbH netsolutions, WIPO Case No. D2011-1383). On this basis and considering that the Respondent was aware of the Complainants\u2019 trademark while he registered the Disputed Domain Name in issue, the Panel finds that the Disputed Domain Name has been registered in bad faith.\nFurther, by holding its registration of the Disputed Domain Name the Respondent has also prevented the Complainants from reflecting their well-known trademarks ALDI for goods or services under the generic Top-Level Domain (\u201cgTLD) \u201c.com\u201d.\nThe Panel finds that the Respondent has registered the Disputed Domain Name in bad faith and that the Respondent is also, by passively holding it under circumstances, as indicated in Telstra Corporation Limited v. Nuclear Marshmallows, WIPO Case No. D2000-0003, using it in bad faith, all within the meaning of paragraph 4(b)(iv) and 4(a)(iii) of the Policy.\nIn light of the above, the Panel confirms that the conditions for transfer of the Disputed Domain Name to the Complainants are satisfied.": [

"Jinan City, Shandong Province, China, the  \nrespondent cannot credibly claim to have been unaware of the mark. \nConsidering the well-knownness of the Complainant\u2019s trademark and the same region, \nthe Panel holds that the Respondent knew the Co mplainant\u2019s trademark prior to \nregistering the domain name. As the domain name would cause confusion to internet \nusers, it should have avoided the registration, wh ich is considered as good faith ; \nrather it registered the disputed domain name. The Respondent deliberately sought to \ncause such confusion. Accordingly the Panel holds that the disputed domain name \nhas been registered in bad faith. \n(2) The disputed domain name is being used in bad faith \nParagraph 4(b) (iv) of the Policy states that the following c ircumstances in particular \nshall be evidence of registration and use of a domain name in bad faith:  By using the \ndomain name, the respondent has intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial \ngain, internet users to its website or other online location , by creating a likelihood of \nconfusion with the complainant\u2019s mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or \nendorsement of its website or location or of a product or service on its website or \nlocation.  \nThe Complainant asserts that the information a bout the Complainant is shown on the \nRespondent\u2019s website . The Complainant \u2019s trademarks, \u201c \u4e2d\u56fd\u91cd\u6c7d \u201d (CNHTC in \nChinese characters), \u201cSINOTRUK\u201d and \u201cCNHTC and design \u201d are displayed i n the \nprominent position.  On the screenshot of the Respondent\u2019s website, the Panel sees \nthe following Chinese characters, English words and design:  \n- \u201c\u4e2d\u56fd\u91cd\u6c7d\u201d   \nThis Chinese characters is the abbreviation of the Complainant\u2019s Chinese name, \u4e2d\u56fd\n\u91cd\u578b\u6c7d\u8f66\u96c6\u56e2\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8.  \u201c\u4e2d\u56fd\u91cd\u6c7d\u201d was registered as a trademark in combination \nwith \u201cSINOTRUK\u201d, \u201cCNHTC\u201d and de sign in classes 35, 39, 41 and 42 prior to the \nregistration date of the disputed domain name. \n- \u201cSINOTRUK\u201d  \n\u201cSINOTRUK\u201d is the Complainant \u2019s trademark registered on September 21, 2006 on \nthe goods of trucks in c lass 12, which the Panel know s from its Decision on the \ndisputed domain name \u201csinotruk.net\u201d (ADNDRC Case No. CN-1701082). \n- \u201cCNHTC and design\u201d  \n\u201cCNHTC\u201d is the abbreviation of the Complainant \u2019s English name, CHINA NATIONAL \nHEAVY DUTY TRUCK GROUP CO., LTD. \u201cCNHTC and design\u201d was registered as a \ntrademark on goods and services in more than 20 classes prior to the registration date \nof the disputed domain name.\n13 \nConsidering that  the disputed domain name is confusingly similar to the \nComplainant\u2019s trademark and the English name of the Respondent is identical with the \nComplainant\u2019s registered trademark, \u201cSINOTRUK\u201d, the use of the Complainant \u2019s \ntrademarks by the Respondent on the prominent part of its website will  cause \nconfusion among consumers as to the source of the products. The Panel believes that \nthe use of the domain name is in bad faith, which meets Paragraph 4(b) (iv). \nIn view of all above, the Panel holds that the disputed domain name should be \nconsidered as having been registered and being used in bad faith under paragraph \n4(b) of the Policy. Therefore, th e Complainant has proven that the third element \nrequired by paragraph 4(a) of the Policy is established.  \n \n5. Decision \nFor all the foregoing reasons, in accordance with Paragraph 4(i) of the Policy and \nParagraph 15 of the Rules, the Panel orders that the d omain name \u201c cnhtc.asia\u201d be \ntransferred to the Complainant , CHINA NATIONAL HEAVY DUTY TRUCK GROUP \nCO., LTD": [

The trademark ELSEVIER was also registered in the United States of America on May 14, 1963 in International Class 16, paper goods and printed matter.\nThe Complainant and its associated companies have made extensive use of the names \"Elsevier\" and \"Elsevier Science\" in relation to the publication of scientific, technical and medical information under and by reference to the name \"Elsevier Science\" since at least 1946.\n  5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\n(i) The domain names are identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the Complainant has rights.\nComplainant submits that the Complainant and its associated companies are the holders of a number of registered trademarks throughout the world which include the word \"Elsevier\". (Annex 7 to the Complaint).\nThe Complainant and its associated companies are also the holders of unregistered trade marks in respect of the names \"Elsevier\" and \"Elsevier Science\" by virtue of the extensive use made of these words by the Complainant and its associated companies in relation to the publication of scientific, technical and medical information under and by reference to the name Elsevier Science since at least 1946.\nComplainant submits that the domain names in dispute <elsevierscience.com> and <elsevier-science.com> are confusingly similar to the registered and unregistered marks of the Complainant and its associated companies.\n(ii) The Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain names.\nComplainant submits that the names \"Elsevier\" and \"Elsevier Science\" are unique to the Complainant and its associated companies. The Complainant or its associated companies are aware of no other use of these names anywhere in the world other than by companies connected with it. \"Elsevier\" is a word which bears no meaning other than to indicate the business run by the Complainant and its associated companies.\n(iii) The domain names have been registered and are being used in bad faith.\nComplainant submits that the registration and continued holding of the domain names in dispute by the Respondent amounts to the Respondent acting in bad faith for the following basic reasons:\n- the Complainant's name \"Elsevier Science\" has a strong reputation and is widely known, as evidenced by its substantial use world-wide;\n- the Respondent can have no bona fide reason for its registration of these domain names;\n- the Respondent has taken active steps to conceal its true identity, by operating under a name which appears to be borrowed from a fictional language;\n- the Respondent has actively provided, and failed to correct, false contact details, in breach of its registration agreement; and\nTaking into account these factors above, it is not possible to conceive of any plausible, actual or contemplated active use of either of these domain names that would not be illegitimate, such by being passing off, or an infringement of the Complainant's rights under trade mark law.\nB.

The Complainant has also cited eight other cases under the Policy in which the previous registrant has been a respondent.\nThe Complainant contends that the disputed domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith. The Respondent must have been aware of the Complainant and its trademark at the time of registration of the disputed domain name, particularly since that has been redirected to the Complainant's UK website. Registration of the disputed domain name must therefore have been in bad faith. The Complainant infers that the Respondent\u2019s intentions for the disputed domain name may have been variously to sell it for profit, to derive pay-per-click revenue, or to make commercial gain by fraud or otherwise through confusion with the Complainant\u2019s trademark. The Complainant reiterates its conclusion that the previous registrant and the present purported registrant are under common control and says that allegedly fraudulent emails sent by the previous registrant form a part of the Respondent\u2019s activities with the disputed domain name.\nThe Complainant has cited previous decisions under the Policy that it considers supportive of its case.\nThe Complainant requests the transfer of the disputed domain name.\nComplainant\u2019s Supplemental Filing\nThe Complainant requested leave to introduce new evidence that could not have been included in the Complaint at the date it was submitted. The new evidence comprised a series of emails forwarded to the Complainant by an individual who in July 2020, had been contemplating an investment appearing to be promoted by the Complainant, including an extensive brochure or prospectus for the investment, together with detailed payment instructions. The Complainant says it has no connection with the purported investment, which is fraudulent.\nB. Respondent\nThe": [

"Sunnyvale, California, not Oregon. The Complaint includes evidence of the Respondent\u2019s prior awareness of the Complainant, as both Mr. Burgess and Dr. Prause criticized the Complainant and the Complainant\u2019s website on social media long before the Domain Name was registered. The Complainant points to the Respondent\u2019s conduct in SEO and web browser tab coding, and its obfuscation of the source or affiliation of the Respondent\u2019s website, as deliberate efforts to mislead Internet users.\nB. Respondent\nThe Respondent does not deny that the Domain Name is meant to refer to the Complainant\u2019s website and book. The Respondent observes, however, that the Complainant does not have a trademark registration for the term \u201cyour brain on porn\u201d and challenges the Complainant\u2019s claim to a common law mark. The Respondent argues that the term is merely descriptive and is used by others, pointing out that it appears in two other book titles, \u201cThis Is Your Brain on Porn\u201d by Karen Kropf and \u201cYour Brain on Porn\u201d by Luke Gilkerson. These follow the well-known pattern of the \u201cThis is your brain on drugs\u201d public service campaign of the 1980s in the United States (depicting an egg cracked and fried). That pattern has been emulated since in \u201cyour brain on alcohol\u201d and other addiction memes, or parodies thereof, in print and social media. The Respondent concludes that such a \u201chighly descriptive\u201d term as the Domain Name could not function as a trademark and would not, in any event, exclusively identify the Complainant. The Respondent also contends that the substantive modifier \u201creal\u201d in the Domain Name avoids confusion because it signals Internet users that \u201cthey are not headed to a website likely to be controlled by [the] Complainant\u201d.\nThe Respondent claims a legitimate interest in using the Domain Name to \u201ceducate the public\u201d and host criticism of the Complainant\u2019s views. The Respondent states that \u201c[t]here is no commercial aspect [of] this site whatsoever\u201d. The Respondent\u2019s position is articulated as follows:\n\u201cIt is well settled that a critic has the right to use the target\u2019s mark in the domain name of a critical site. Determinations regarding legitimate, noncommercial and fair use under the Policy require a balancing of trademark holder and other public interests. [The] Respondent provides information to the public regarding the effects of the use of pornography. These activities are protected not only by the First Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution, but also Paragraph (4)(c)(iii) of the UDRP Policy. [The] Respondent is engaged in legitimate noncommercial and fair use in their domain name, which criticizes [the] Complainants\u2019 views\u201d.\nThe Respondent denies any intent to mislead Internet users, employ the Domain Name for commercial gain, disrupt the Complainant\u2019s website or activities, or otherwise act in bad faith within the meaning of the Policy.\n6. Discussion and Findings\nParagraph 4(a) of the Policy provides that in order to divest a respondent of a domain name, a complainant must demonstrate each of the following:\n(i) the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and\n(ii) the respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and\n(iii) the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\nUnder paragraph 15(a) of the Rules, \u201cA Panel shall decide a complaint on the basis of the statements and documents submitted and in accordance with the Policy, these Rules and any rules and principles of law that it deems applicable\u201d.\n6.1 Multiple Respondents\nMr. Burgess is properly named as a Respondent because he registered the Domain Name. There is no evidence in the record that Family Life Services is a legal entity; it may be a trade name or alter ego for Mr. Burgess.\nThe Amended Complaint also names Dr. Nicole Prause and Liberos LLC as Respondents. They do not appear in the Registrar\u2019s WhoIs database in relation to the Domain Name, but there are reasons to believe that Dr. Prause is a leading person in the \u201cgroup of psychologists and scientists\u201d that is responsible for the Respondent\u2019s website, according to the Response. She is the second-listed expert on the site, with her affiliation shown as \u201cLiberos\u201d. Two of the experts who replied to the Complainant\u2019s demand letter said they participated at her invitation. The law firm that responded on her behalf to the Complainant\u2019s demand letter is the same law firm that represents the Respondent in this proceeding. Dr. Prause \u201cDBA Liberos LLC\u201d applied for United States trademark registration of YOUR BRAIN ON PORN. The online database of the California Secretary of State shows that Liberos LLC is a California limited liability company, for which Nicole Prause is the registered agent.\nThe Panel finds substantial evidence that Mr. Burgess, Dr. Prause, and Liberos LLC share involvement in the control of the website associated with the Domain Name, as well as common interests in this proceeding, and there has been no showing of material prejudice to them in the event that the proceeding continues with Dr. Prause and Liberos LLC as named Respondents. See WIPO Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions, Third Edition (\u201cWIPO Overview 3.0\u201d), section 4.11.2.\nAccordingly, the Panel allows the Complaint against multiple respondents as styled in the caption above and refers to these parties collectively hereafter as the \u201cRespondent\u201d.\nA. Identical or Confusingly Similar\nThe first element of a UDRP complaint \u201cfunctions primarily as a standing requirement\u201d and entails \u201ca straightforward comparison between the complainant\u2019s trademark and the domain name\u201d. See WIPO Overview 3.0, section 1.7. The Complainant holds a United Kingdom trademark registration for a figurative mark prominently featuring the term \u201cYour Brain on Porn\u201d. (The fact that this mark was registered nearly two months after the Domain Name was registered is not relevant for this standing requirement of the first element of the Complaint, although it may be relevant under other elements.)\nThe Complainant also cites its pending United States trademark applications, but as these are not registrations, they do not by themselves represent \u201crights\u201d on which the Complainant can rely for standing. More to the point, the Complainant claims common law rights in the term \u201cYour Brain on Porn\u201d. A Complainant may assert rights in an unregistered mark in a UDRP proceeding, but this requires proof:\n\u201cTo establish unregistered or common law trademark rights for purposes of the UDRP, the complainant must show that its mark has become a distinctive identifier which consumers associate with the complainant\u2019s goods and/or services.\nRelevant evidence demonstrating such acquired distinctiveness (also referred to as secondary meaning) includes a range of factors such as (i) the duration and nature of use of the mark, (ii) the amount of sales under the mark, (iii) the nature and extent of advertising using the mark, (iv) the degree of actual public (e.g., consumer, industry, media) recognition, and (v) consumer surveys\u201d. (WIPO Overview 3.0, section 1.3)\nHere, the Complainant has adduced substantial evidence of trademark use of YOUR BRAIN ON PORN since publishing a book by that name in 2014. The term has been attached not only to the Complainant\u2019s website and book but also to videos, lectures, workshops, and ancillary materials, some with a figurative logo (displaying the \u201cTM\u201d symbol) or the initials YBOP and some with the words alone. The Complaint includes information about book sales, site visits, and downloads, as well as media recognition.\nThe Respondent argues that the term is merely descriptive, but this argument is undercut by two facts: (1) the Respondent Dr. Prause herself has a pending trademark application for precisely the same term as a standard character mark, and (2) a USPTO examiner, reviewing one of the Complainant\u2019s pending trademark applications for the same term, has opined in a non-final action letter that the phrase is \u201cregistrable\u201d. It remains to be seen whether the USPTO will grant either the Complainant\u2019s or the Respondent\u2019s pending trademark applications for YOUR BRAIN ON PORN, but, also noting the Respondent\u2019s clear knowledge of and intent to target the Complainant, the Panel finds sufficient evidence on this record that the Complainant has common law rights in the term to afford standing under the Policy.\nThe Domain Name incorporates the Complainant\u2019s registered and common law YOUR BRAIN ON PORN mark in its entirety and adds the word \u201creal\u201d at the beginning of the string. As in most cases, the generic Top-Level Domain (\u201cgTLD\u201d) \u201c.com\u201d is disregarded. Id.,section 1.7. The Complainant contends that \u201creal\u201d is a dictionary word that emphasizes genuineness and so does not avoid confusing similarity. The Respondent counters that \u201creal\u201d distinguishes the Domain Name sufficiently to avoid confusion because it highlights the critical nature of the Respondent\u2019s website, which attacks the Complainant\u2019s \u201cfraudulent\u201d credentials and lack of genuine scientific support. The Panel is not persuaded that Internet users will interpret the Domain Name in this manner, believing that \u201creal\u201d means \u201cas opposed to\u201d. After all, one of the most widely quoted Twitter accounts in recent years is @realDonaldTrump, which is an authentic account at the time of this Decision.\nThe Panel finds that the Domain Name is confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s YOUR BRAIN ON PORN mark for Policy purposes and concludes that the Complainant has established the first element of the Complaint.\nB. Rights or Legitimate Interests\nParagraph 4(c) of the Policy gives non-exclusive examples of instances in which the Respondents may establish rights or legitimate interests in the Domain Name, by demonstrating any of the following:\n(i) before any notice to it of the dispute, the Respondent\u2019s use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the Domain Name or a name corresponding to the Domain Name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services; or\n(ii) that the Respondent has been commonly known by the Domain Name, even if it has acquired no trademark or service mark rights; or\n(iii) the Respondent is making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the Domain Name, without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue.\nSince a respondent in a UDRP proceeding is in the best position to assert rights or legitimate interests in a domain name, it is well established that after a complainant makes a prima facie case, the burden of production on this element shifts to the respondent to come forward with relevant evidence of its rights or legitimate interests in the domain name. See WIPO Overview 3.0, section 2.1. Here, the Complainant has grounded its prima facie case by establishing its trademark rights, confusing similarity, and a lack of permissive use. This should shift the burden to the Respondent.\nThe Respondent relies on paragraph 4(c)(iii), arguing that it is making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the Domain Name for education and criticism, repeatedly emphasizing that \u201cthere is no commercial aspect of the site whatsoever\u201d. This is not entirely true, however. The Respondent\u2019s website certainly offers information and links to published research, but it also encourages users to interact with the listed experts, many of whom are therapists who consult with patients as their business. As such, the website has some characteristics of a specialist professional directory with direct links to experts who can in some cases turn inquiries into clients. One of the experts even provides a direct link to his clinic\u2019s website with a \u201cbook appointments\u201d tab. At least five of the listed experts include direct links to Amazon.com pages to purchase their books. There is no \u201cshopping cart\u201d function on the Respondent\u2019s website, but it is literally one click away. And with taglines such as \u201cVisit with real experts on pornography!\u201d the website does appear to promote the professional services of those experts who have clinical practices, to an audience of persons who may well be interested in availing themselves of their services.\nThe Response effectively acknowledges that the Domain Name refers to the Complainant\u2019s website and other publications branded YOUR BRAIN ON PORN:\n\u201cThey have an absolute right to use Complainant\u2019s mark to call attention to the subject of the criticism contained on the site. Respondent is not attempting to trick the public into thinking they are the same or sponsored by Complainant. There is no evidence that anything like this has happened. In fact, the name of their domain does exactly the opposite. It informs the public that Respondent espouses exactly the opposite of Complainant\u2019s views. This use of Complainant\u2019s mark as a part of their domain name is fully protected by both the United States Constitution and Paragraph 4(c)(iii)\u201d.\nHowever, incorporating the Complainant\u2019s mark in its entirety raises a high risk of implied affiliation, and simply prefacing it with the word \u201creal\u201d does not firmly convey the impression of criticism or opposition rather than authenticity (see the example of @realDonaldTrump noted above in discussing confusing similarity). \u201cFundamentally, a respondent\u2019s use of a domain name will not be considered \u2018fair\u2019 if it falsely suggests affiliation with the trademark owner\u201d. WIPO Overview 3.0, section 2.5. The Domain Name alone is ambiguous, but WIPO UDRP panels assessing fairness have looked to circumstances beyond the domain name itself, such as the following:\n\u201c(i) whether the domain name has been registered and is being used for legitimate purposes and not as a pretext for commercial gain or other such purposes inhering to the respondent\u2019s benefit, (ii) whether the respondent reasonably believes its use (whether referential, or for praise or criticism) to be truthful and well-founded, (iii) whether it is clear to Internet users visiting the respondent\u2019s website that it is not operated by the complainant, (iv) whether the respondent has refrained from engaging in a pattern of registering domain names corresponding to marks held by the complainant or third parties, (v) where appropriate, whether a prominent link (including with explanatory text) is provided to the relevant trademark owner\u2019s website, (vi) whether senders of email intended for the complainant but (because of user confusion) directed to the respondent are alerted that their message has been misdirected, (vii) whether there is an actual connection between the complainant\u2019s trademark in the disputed domain name and the corresponding website content, and not to a competitor, or an entire industry, group, or individual, and (viii) whether the domain name registration and use by the respondent is consistent with a pattern of bona fide activity (whether online or offline)\u201d. WIPO Overview 3.0, section 2.5.2.\nIn this case, the individuals responsible for contributing content to the Respondent\u2019s website appear to express genuinely held opinions, although the authors remain anonymous. They primarily furnish summaries and links to peer-reviewed articles published in scientific journals. There is no evidence of a pattern of cybersquatting, fraudulent email appropriation, or exploitation of the Domain Name for pay-per-click advertising or direct commercial competition.\nThose responsible for the website have not avoided a risk of confusion with the Complainant, however, and in some respects have deliberately amplified that confusion, as follows: the Respondent\u2019s website does not identify the website operator; it only briefly included a disclaimer of affiliation with the Complainant; the Domain Name registration was made through a domain privacy service; the Respondent\u2019s press release regarding the website launch might lead Internet users to associate the website with the Complainant; the Respondent does not deny that the SEO coding is designed to cause search engines to confuse the Respondent\u2019s website with the Complainant\u2019s; and until recently, the Respondent\u2019s website was coded to display the Complainant\u2019s YOUR BRAIN ON PORN and YBOP marks in the browser tab of the Respondent\u2019s website. While it should be clear to a site visitor actually reading the website content that the Respondent is critical rather than supportive of the Complainant, some of the Respondent\u2019s practices in this case seem to be calculated to attract Internet users interested in the Complainant and heighten rather than avoid the effects of initial interest confusion.\nHowever, if confusion is the chief fairness concern with the Respondent\u2019s use of the Domain Name, it must be balanced against the Respondent\u2019s claimed noncommercial interest in using the Complainant\u2019s mark for genuine criticism of the Complainant. See WIPO Overview 3.0, sections 2.6, 2.5.3. Depending on the facts of the case and where, as here, all Parties reside in the United States, UDRP panels have tended to give weight to United States constitutional First Amendment principles of free speech in respecting the interests of a respondent using a domain name for a criticism site despite the inherent risk of confusion with the trademark owner, unless the respondent is found to be using the supposed \u201ccriticism site\u201d as a pretext for cybersquatting, commercial activity, or tarnishment. See id., section 2.6.1; MUFG Union Bank, N.A. v. William Bookout, WIPO Case No. D2014-1821.\nHere, the asserted noncommercial character of the Respondent\u2019s website is not as pure as the Respondent claims. Site visitors are invited to interact individually through the website with experts who in some cases are therapists who make a living selling their professional services to clients. Several of the experts not only mention their publications but link to the relevant Amazon.com page for a convenient one-click purchase. There is in this sense a commercial advertising aspect to the Respondent\u2019s website, particularly for the experts who are in private practice.\nOn balance, though, the Panel finds this commercial aspect to be subsidiary to the predominantly informational and advocacy purposes of the Respondent\u2019s website. Several of the Respondent\u2019s experts articulate their views and findings in books, but the Respondent\u2019s website is not focused on selling books. Some publications, such as those listed above, are actually linked to Amazon.com, while others, such as Victoria Hartmann\u2019s \u201cI Like Dead People \u2013 Inside the Mind of Death Fetishists\u201d and Charles Moser\u2019s contribution to the \u201cHandbook of Psychology\u201d, are only mentioned rather than linked. The book references amount to a small fraction of the content on the website. And while the Respondent\u2019s website publishes information about its experts and facilitates contacts with them, it does not directly sell their services. Moreover, those services do not compete professionally with the Complainant, who is not a licensed therapist.\nThe Panel finds that the limited and almost incidental commercial aspect of the Respondent\u2019s website does not overshadow its primarily noncommercial nature as a genuine criticism site. See WIPO Overview 3.0, section 2.5.3 (\u201cspecific case factors have led panels to find that fair use need not always be categorically noncommercial\u201d \u2026 panels look for \u201cunambiguous evidence that the site is not primarily intended for commercial gain\u201d). Even with the evidence of the Respondent\u2019s efforts to heighten a risk of user confusion, which also detracts from its \u201cfair use\u201d of the Domain Name, the Panel finds on balance that the Respondent\u2019s interests in critical expression outweigh the risk of confusion with the Complainant\u2019s mark.\nThe Panel concludes that the Respondent prevails on the second element of the Complaint.\nC. Registered and Used in Bad Faith\nThe Policy, paragraph 4(b), furnishes a non-exhaustive list of circumstances that \u201cshall be evidence of the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith\u201d, including the following suggested by the Complainant (in which \u201cyou\u201d refers to the registrant of the domain name):\n\u201c(iv) by using the domain name, you have intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to your website or other online location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant\u2019s mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of your website or location or of a product or service on your website or location\u201d.\nThe Respondent\u2019s use of the Domain Name for at least some commercial purposes, as discussed above, could well suffice to establish bad faith for purposes of paragraph 4(b)(iv), supported by the cited evidence of the Respondent\u2019s apparent efforts to exacerbate a risk of user confusion. However, given the Respondent\u2019s ability in this case to rely on the justification of fair use for a criticism site and the Panel\u2019s conclusion on the second element, which is dispositive of the Complaint, there is no need to reach a conclusion on the third element.\n7. Decision\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Complaint is denied.\n": [

"Cina, Stati Uniti, Giappone, Federazione Russa e Unione Europea, e registrazione di marchio dell\u2019Unione Europea No. 5301999 INTESA SANPAOLO, concessa il 18 giugno 2007 per le classi 35, 36 e 38.\nIl Collegio riconosce che il nome a dominio contestato induce a confusione con il marchio del Ricorrente poich\u00e9 riproduce il marchio INTESA SANPAOLO con la mera aggiunta del termine \u201ccorporate\u201d, descrittivo della natura aziendale del Ricorrente e che quindi non riduce il rischio di confusione.\nIl Collegio quindi decide che il Ricorrente ha provato l\u2019elemento del paragrafo 4(a)(i) della Policy.\nB. Assenza di diritti o d\u2019interessi legittimi del Resistente in relazione al nome a dominio contestato\nIl Ricorrente sostiene, credibilmente, che il Resistente non abbia alcun diritto o interesse legittimo in relazione al nome a dominio contestato. In assenza di una Risposta del Resistente, il Collegio conclude che il Resistente non ha alcun diritto o interesse legittimo in relazione al nome a dominio contestato.\nIl Collegio quindi decide che il Richiedente ha provato l\u2019elemento del paragrafo 4(a)(ii) della Policy.\nC. Registrazione e Uso in Malafede\nConsiderando che il Richiedente \u00e8 un maggiore gruppo bancario e che il suo marchio INTESA SANPAOLO \u00e8 ben noto, il Collegio conclude che il Resistente aveva ovviamente conoscenza di tale marchio quando registr\u00f2 il nome a dominio contestato, e che quindi registr\u00f2 il nome a dominio in malafede.\nIl nome a dominio contestato \u00e8 collegato ad una pagina web con il seguente contenuto: \u201cQuesto dominio \u00e8 gi\u00e0 registrato. Ti interessa questo nome?\u201d Questo contenuto, ed in particolare la domanda \u201cti interessa questo nome?\u201d indica che il nome a dominio contestato venne registrato ed \u00e8 utilizzato con l\u2019intenzione di rivendere il nome a dominio contestato a scopo di lucro ai sensi del paragrafo 4(b)(i) della Policy. Inoltre, il Collegio conclude che il Resistente usa il nome a dominio in malafede, poich\u00e9 ove (come nel caso in esame) non \u00e8 concepibile un uso in buona fede, la detenzione passiva di un nome a dominio costituisce un uso malafede (Telstra Corporation Limited v. Nuclear Marshmallows, WIPO Case No. D2000-0003).\nIl Collegio quindi decide che il Richiedente ha provato l\u2019elemento del paragrafo 4(a)(iii) della Policy.\n7. Decisione\nPer i motivi sopra esposti e ai sensi dei paragrafi 4(i) della Policy e 15 delle Norme, il Collegio dispone il trasferimento a favore del Ricorrente del nome a dominio contestato <intesasanpaolocorporate.com>": [],

"Croatia, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Slovenia and Taiwan. The combined average circulation of the international editions is approximately 2 million copies monthly.\nPlayboy owns thousands of registrations for the Playboy mark worldwide including over twenty-five registrations for the mark PLAYBOY in Italy protecting a variety of goods and services. True and correct copies of the certificates of registrations for said registrations were attached as Annex to the Complaint.\nPlayboy has spent substantial time, effort and money advertising and promoting the PLAYBOY trademark throughout the United States and the world. As a result, the PLAYBOY mark has become internationally famous and Playboy has developed substantial goodwill in its PLAYBOY mark. The distinctiveness, strength and fame of the PLAYBOY mark has been acknowledged by a number of courts. See, e.g., Playboy Enters, Inc. v. Baccarat Clothing Co, Inc., 692 F.2d 1272 (9th Cir. 1982), (PLAYBOY trademark is distinctive, strong and has acquired great fame); and Playboy Enters, Inc. v. AsiaFocus Int\u2019l, Inc., 1998, WL 724000 (E.D.Va. April 10, 1998), (noting that fame of the PLAYBOY mark is beyond dispute). Also, see Playboy v. Giannattasio, (Court of Naples, January 14, 1999, Giurisprudenza Annotata di Diritto Industriale, Giuffr\u00e8, 1040, 1999): \"The trademark PLAYBOY for its certain renown at worldwide level, is entitled to complete, full and total protection\u2026\" See also, (Board of Appeal of Naples, March 24, 1999, id.) \"the PLAYBOY trademark.\u2026belonging to the category of the so-called strong trademarks, is precisely in the name PLAYBOY, name which for its remarkable distinctiveness impresses itself with particular strength in the perception of the consumer. And this is the more so since such name has become exceptionally renown....\"\nIn connection with the PLAYBOY trademark, Playboy has an established presence on the Internet through its Websites, including those located at the domain names <playboy.com>, <playboytv.com>, <playboystore.com>, <playboyauctions.com> and the \"playboy cyber club\" site (collectively, the \"Playboy Websites\"). The Playboy Websites allow computer users worldwide to access information regarding Playboy and the Playboy Goods and Services. Printouts from the Playboy Websites were included as Annex to the Complaint.\nRespondent\u2019s Registration and Use of the Domain Name\nAccording to Complainant, Respondent has no connection or affiliation with Playboy. Respondent has not received any license or consent, express or implied, to use Playboy\u2019s famous PLAYBOY trademark in a domain name or in any other manner.\nAs evidence of Respondent\u2019s bad faith registration and use of the domain name, Complainant submitted a copy of the Complaint and the decision in WIPO Case No. D2001-0745 <playboy-photographer.com>, which was a case between the same parties. The registration and use of the domain name <playboysexygirls.com> took place and began after the Respondent was notified of the previous Complaint filed against it by Playboy in regard to <playboy-photographer.com>. The Respondent admitted his reason for registering the domain name in his e-mail of July 7, 2001:\n\"Since you do not understand\u2026. I thought to make you a present \"www.playboysexygirls.com\". Now you have to chase again.Hahhahahahahaahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaha.\nThe combinations of the name Playboy are almost infinite and then there are the territorial suffixes too! < .net> <.org> <.uk> <.mc> <.co> <.za> <.tv>. A little example\u2026multiply US$ 3.000 for each country (money you have to give to wipo to try to obtain the domain) I only spend $35 for each domain (a little \u2026formal difference), and suffix and you will have more or less US$ 4.000.000!!!!! ahhahah (8 billion) euro 4.000.000. This calculation only refers to the territorial variables of the name playboy-photographer. etc etc etc": [

"Panama, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, UAE, United Kingdom, Uruguay, USA, Venezuela and is the proprietor of pending applications for this mark in CTM and Ireland.\nThe Complainant is also the proprietor of the trademark <TSB> and has registrations for said trademark in the following jurisdictions: Guernsey, Italy, Jersey, Spain, United Kingdom. In addition the Complainant has pending applications for this trademark in CTM and Japan.\nThe Complainant has not furnished any evidence of its registrations or pending applications for these marks other than a copy of the Registration Certificate for the United Kingdom series.\nThe Complainant submits that the said domain name is confusingly similar to the Complainant's registered service mark.\nAs regards the rights or legitimate interest of the Respondent in the said domain name, the Complainant has submitted a print out of the Respondent's site and submits that it is apparent from the www site, that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interest in the said domain name, that the Respondent was aware of the Complainant's rights in the trademark <LLOYDS TSB> and has registered the domain name with the intention of publicising offensive comments about the Complainant, to embarrass the Complainant and to divert customers away from the Complainant.\nAs regards the allegations that the Respondent registered the said domain name and is using the said domain name in bad faith, the Complainant submits that the Respondent is a former customer of the Complainant and that he bears a grudge arising out of this relationship.\nIt is alleged that the Respondent's www site contains material which is untrue, defamatory and offensive. It is further alleged that the Respondent has used copyright material taken from the Complainant's site at lloydstsb.co.uk and another www site elcome.com that is leased by the Complainant. The Complainant submitted extracts from these www sites as evidence in support of its contentions. The Complainant submits that this is evidence of bad faith in that it establishes that the Respondent has the intention of confusing the Complainant's customers.\nFurthermore the Complainant alleges that the Respondent has published on the www site a letter purporting to be further criticism of the Complainant's service mark made by a third party, which is expressed in highly offensive language. The Complainant has submitted a copy of said letter and alleges that it has been incorporated into the site with the intention of harming the Complainant's reputation and to tarnish the Complainant's trademark.\nThe Complainant further alleges that the Respondent has incorporated various links in this site which lead to the sites of the Complainant's principal competitors, namely Barclays Bank, HSBC and Virgin One. It is alleged that in providing these links the Respondent deliberately intended to harm the Complainant's business, to deter prospective customers and to divert existing customers to the Complainant's competitors.\nB. Respondent\nThe Respondent submits that there is no company trading under the name <lloydstsb-visa.com>, that the name was registered for the purpose of displaying factual material that the respondent legitimately received, that the domain name was legitimately linked to other material and that the domain name was registered and is being used in good faith.\nThe Respondent submits that the Complainant has sought to mislead the Administrative Panel in alleging that the Respondent is in debt to the Complainant.\nThe Respondent makes a number of submissions relating to the content of his www site, in particular that his allegations that the Complainant has a customer intimidation policy which is operated through debt collecting agencies. He submits that the statements on his www site are not defamatory or untrue.\nIt is also submitted that customers would not be confused into believing that his www site was connected with the Complainant because of the use of \"blue\" language on the site.\nThe Respondent submits that he removed a black horse logo from his site as soon as he became aware of the Complainant\u2019s concerns in this regard. Similarly the Respondent removed all links from the site once he became aware of the Complainant's concerns\n  6. Discussion and Findings\nThis Administrative Panel accepts that there is an ongoing dispute between the parties in relation to a small sum of money. The Respondent would appear to see this as an issue of principle. It is obvious that the Complainant is correct is stating that the Respondent holds a grudge in respect of this dispute. The Complainant has alleged that the subject matter of the Respondent's www site is untrue, defamatory and offensive. This dispute and the allegations of the Complainant are outside the jurisdiction of this Administrative Panel.\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of the Policy, the Complainant is required to satisfy this Administrative Panel:\n(i) that the Respondent's domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and\n(ii) the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and\n(iii) the said domain has been registered and is being used in bad faith. As regards the Complainant's trade marks, the Complainant has established that it is the registered proprietor of <LLOYDS TSB>, registered in the United Kingdom in class 36 under No. 2148403. Furthermore this Administrative Panel is satisfied that it has common law rights in the <LLOYDS TSB> mark. Furthermore the Complainant submits that it is licensed to use the <VISA> trademark and has established that its predecessor in title, Lloyds Bank, has held such licence since 1987. This Administrative Panel must therefore decide as to whether the said domain name is identical or confusingly similar to the Complainant's <LLOYDS TSB> service mark. Since both Parties are resident in England it seems appropriate that the laws of England and Wales should be applied to this question. In Pianotist Co's Application (1906) 23 R.P.C. 774 at 777 Parker J. set out what has become the standard test for comparison: \"You must take the two words. You must judge them, both by their look and by their sound. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who would be likely to buy those goods. In fact you must consider all the surrounding circumstances; and you must further consider what is likely to happen if each of those trade marks is used in a normal way as a trade mark for goods of the respective owners of the marks.\" Applying this test, this Administrative Panel is satisfied that the domain name is confusingly similar to the Respondent's service marks.The next question this Administrative Panel must address is whether the Complainant has established a prima facie case that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name. Paragraph 4 (c) of the Policy provides some examples of how the Respondent can have such rights and interests viz. (i) if he can show use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services before any notice to him of the dispute; or(ii) if he (as an individual, business, or other organization) has been commonly known by the domain name, even if he has acquired no trademark or service mark rights; or(iii) if he is making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name, without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue.The Respondent has not made any claim to have used or prepared to use the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services. Neither does he make any claim to have been commonly known by the domain name. The domain name is a combination of the Complainants service mark and the <visa> service mark which the Complainant is licensed to use. It is inconceivable that the Respondent could satisfy any of the criteria set out in paragraph 4(a)(ii) of the Policy.The Respondent has submitted that he has a right to comment on the Complainant's services. This is quite distinct from the right in the name/domain. The Respondents right to complain is not a matter for this Administrative Panel.This Administrative Panel is satisfied that the Respondent is using the domain name with the intention of diverting consumers from the Complainant and to tarnish the Complainant's reputation. It is not necessary for us to decide whether such use may be classified as commercial or noncommercial for the purposes of the policy. We therefore conclude that the Complainant has established that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name.As to whether the Complainant has registered the domain name in bad faith, it is common cause that the Respondent registered the domain name to establish a www site primarily to publish critical comments about the Complainant, to publicize his dispute with the intention of disrupting the Complainant's business.Since registration, the Respondent has established such a www site and inter alia by using copyright material of the Complainant, has given this site an appearance, at least initially, (akin to initial interest confusion) giving the impression that there is some connection between the site and the Complainant. It is all the more unacceptable that he has used what has been described as \"blue\" language on this site. Furthermore he has created links to the www sites of the Respondent's competitors and in the view of this Administrative Panel these links were established to divert custom away from the Complainant.Paragraph 4(b) of the Policy sets out certain activities which an Administrative Panel may accept as evidence of registration and use in bad faith. One of the examples given is that the domain name has been registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor. The Respondent is not a competitor of the Complainant, however in the view of this Administrative Panel, his use of the Complainant's copyright material, the fact that he registered the domain name and is using the domain name with the sole intention of publicising focused critical comment about the Complainant and has provided links to the Complainant's competitors with a view to actively diverting custom away from the Complainant, taken together is sufficient to allow this Administrative Panel to conclude that the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\n  7. Decision\nWith reference to Paragraphs 4(i) of the Policy and rule 15 of the Rules this Administrative Panel decides that the Respondent has registered the domain name <lloydstsb-visa.com> which is identical or confusingly similar to the Complainant's trade mark, that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interest in respect of said domain name and that said domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith by the Respondent.": [

"Interep wrote a cease and desist letter to Ms. Susan Gilmore, the Administrative Contact for Respondent set forth in the <eradio.com> entry in the NSI Whois database\n  5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\n5.1 Respondent\u2019s <eradio.com> domain name is identical or confusingly similar to Interep\u2019s E-RADIO service mark, because the second-level domain name differs from the service mark only by the absence of a hyphenFor purposes of assessing the identity or confusing similarity between domain names and trademarks, top-level domain extensions (the .com, in this instance), spaces, hyphens, and punctuation are ignoredSee, e.g. Talk City, Inc. v. Michael Robertson, WIPO Domain Name Dispute Case D2000-0009 (finding the <talk-city.com> domain name to be identical or confusingly similar to the trademark TALK CITY).\n5.2 Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the <eradio.com> domain nameOn information and belief, Respondent holds the <eradio.com> domain name solely for the purpose of selling the domain name to Interep or to one of Interep\u2019s competitors for consideration in excess of Respondent\u2019s out-of-pocket costsRespondent does not use the <eradio.com> domain name on the InternetAs of the date of this Complaint, Respondent does not maintain a single page on the world wide web that is linked through the URL http://www.eradio.comAdditionally, Respondent holds the registrations for scores of domain names, far in excess of the number of domains that Respondent could conceivably utilize for bona fide business purposes in association with the provision of goods and servicesRespondent\u2019s sole use of the <eradio.com> domain name is to make it available for sale.\n5.3 Just as was found by another WIPO Administrative Panel convened to resolve a dispute concerning the <musicweb.com> domain name pursuant to the Rules, Respondent\u2019s conduct and statements to Interep representatives establish that Respondent registered and uses the <eradio.com> domain name in bad faithSee, Ellenbogen v. Pearson, WIPO Domain Name Dispute Case D2000-0001 (concluding that evidence that (i) respondent\u2019s only purpose in registering the <musicweb.com> domain name was to sell the domain for profit, and (ii) there was no actual or intended use of the domain name were \"sufficient evidence of registration and use in bad faith within the meaning of paragraph 4 of the Policy and applicable legal principles\")\nB. Respondent\n5.4 Respondent notes that Complainant\u2019s E-RADIO mark is not arbitrary or fanciful; rather it is, at least, merely descriptiveThe prefix \"e\" in combination with a generic term is in widespread use by third parties to describe \"electronic\" and online activities or services in a shorthand manner, e.g., email/e-mail, e-commerce, ebusiness/e-business, and e-ticketTerms such as e-purchase, e-realty, erealty, emattress, e-pricing, edebit, e-pulp and equiz are all terms registered on the Supplemental Register in the United States, reflecting their descriptive natureThe word \"radio\" is undeniably genericThe combination of the prefix \"e\" and the generic term \"radio,\" used for advertising services on an electronic site accessed through the Internet, does not create a unique composite mark such that Complainant should be given any special protection, since numerous companies use such \"e\" terms to promote their goods and servicesSee Continental Airlines Inc. v. United Air Lines Inc., 53 U.S.P.Q.2d 1385, 1393, 1396-97 (T.T.A.B. 2000) (discussing common use of \"e\" prefix in combination with a generic or descriptive term to denote goods or services delivered electronically or conducted online)Furthermore, the E-RADIO mark can not be considered famous or as having secondary meaning, and Complainant has not provided evidence as suchIn identical situations, panels have routinely favored the domain name holderCar Toys, Inc. v.

Network Systems GA, Inc., National Arbitration Forum Domain Name Dispute Case FA0094188.\n5.5 Respondent has rights and a legitimate interest with respect to the domain nameBefore any notice to Respondent of the dispute, Respondent used the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of servicesSpecifically, Respondent registered the descriptive domain name as part of its domain name website development enterpriseRespondent is in the business of registering domain names that comprise generic or descriptive terms, and developing business-oriented websites using these domain namesRespondent did not plan to sell the <eradio.com> domain name, but rather planned to develop a radio splash website referring people to online radio stations, since it had successfully developed other websitesSeveral ICANN-approved panels have held that exactly such an enterprise creates a legitimate bona fide business interest in the generic or descriptive domain name in the domain name owner.

Prime Domains, National Arbitration Forum Domain Name Dispute Case FA0092531Thus, Respondent\u2019s right and interest in the domain name remained legitimate even after Complainant approached Respondent with its offer to purchase the domain name from RespondentFurthermore, even after being approached by Complainant to sell the domain name, Respondent did not attempt to capitalize on whatever alleged trademark rights Complainant established in the term E-RADIO or to profit from Complainant\u2019s business, and Complainant can provide no evidence of such.\n5.6 Respondent has not registered or used the domain name in bad faithThe Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy established by ICANN clearly requires a domain name to be (1) registered and (2) used by the respondent in bad faithSee Policy 4(a)(iii)Complainant fails to provide evidence of eitherBad faith registration is negated by a finding that the domain name owner registered the domain name prior to the development of trademark rights by another party, and/or that the domain name owner did not know of or could not have known of the complainant and/or the complainant\u2019s trademark rights at the time of registrationAllocation Network GmbH v.

CES Marketing Group, Inc., eResolution Domain Name Dispute Case AF-0104.\n5.7 Respondent is not using the <eradio.com> domain name as yet for an active website and therefore there is no use of it in an intentional attempt to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to its website or other online location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the Complainant\u2019s mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of its web site or location or of a product or service on its web site or locationAs stated previously, Respondent has in no way attempted to capitalize on whatever trademark rights Complainant owns, or to profit from Complainant\u2019s business, and Complainant can provide no evidence of such.\n5.8 Respondent registered the descriptive domain name <eradio.com> in good faith two years before Complainant filed its intent-to-use trademark application for the alleged service mark E-RADIO, and more than three years before Respondent began using the E-RADIO markThus, Respondent registered the domain name long before Complainant established any kind of trademark rights in the termFurthermore, Respondent was not aware of Complainant or of any other entity using ERADIO or any mark similar thereto at the time of its domain name registration.\n5.9 Respondent did not register or acquire the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to Complainant, since Complainant did not have rights in the E-RADIO mark at the time of registration, and since Respondent was unaware of the existence of Complainant at the time of registration.\n5.10 Respondent did not register the descriptive <eradio.com> domain name in an attempt to secure valuable consideration from Complainant in excess of its out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain nameRespondent notes that it did not initiate contact with Complainant and offer to sell the domain name; rather, Complainant approached Respondent offering to buy the domain nameSuch conduct is indicative of the domain name owner\u2019s good faith, not bad faithCar Toys, Inc. v. Informa Unlimited, Inc., National Arbitration Forum Domain Name Dispute Case FA0093682; General Machine Products Co., Inc. v. Prime Domains, National Arbitration Forum Domain Name Dispute Case FA0092531\n5.11 Respondent did not register the domain name <eradio.com> in order to prevent Complainant from reflecting the E-RADIO mark in a corresponding domain name, and has not engaged, as Complainant asserts, in a pattern of such conductAs stated previously, Respondent was not aware of Complainant\u2019s existence at the time it registered the domain name, Complainant was not using the alleged E-RADIO mark at the time Respondent registered the domain name, and Complainant did not commence using the mark for more than three years after Respondent registered the domain nameFurthermore, Respondent registers descriptive or generic terms as domain names for planned use in a legitimate commercial enterprise, and does not engage in a pattern of cybersquatting conduct.\n5.12 Respondent did not register the <eradio.com> domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of ComplainantComplainant\u2019s activities associated with the mark did not begin until more than three years after Respondent registered the domain name in good faithFurthermore, as stated previously, Respondent was not aware of Complainant\u2019s existence at the time it registered the domain nameThus, Respondent could not have registered the mark to disrupt Complainant\u2019s business.\n5.13 Complainant is guilty of reverse domain name hijackingThe fact that Respondent registered the descriptive <eradio.com> domain name more than three years before Complainant began use of the E-RADIO mark should have indicated to Complainant that Respondent was not a cybersquatter of the markFurthermore, Complainant has provided no credible arguments that Respondent registered the domain name in bad faithThe complaint is a blatant bad faith attempt to hijack Respondent\u2019s domain name for Complainant\u2019s benefitComplainant merely wants the descriptive domain name that Respondent happened to register years before the Complainant even thought to adopt the term \"E-RADIO.\" The complaint was brought in bad faith and primarily to harass Respondent, and as such constitutes an abuse of the administrative process.\n  6. Discussion and Findings\n6.1 Complainant must prove each of the following three elements set forth in the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy Paragraph 4(a), namely (i) the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the Complainant has rights; (ii) Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and (iii) the domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faithThe Panel will now look at each one of the elements to determine if Complainant has met its burden of proof.\n6.2 The Panel finds that the Complainant has established valid trademark rights pursuant to Rule 4(a)(i)E-RADIO is a registered service mark in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and is allegedly in use. The Panel will not evaluate the relative \"descriptiveness\" of E-RADIO as a service mark and is satisfied that the service mark is registered and apparently fulfills its function as a service mark in the marketplaceAdditionally, the deletion of the hyphen in the domain name \"eradio.com\" does not affect the identity or confusing similarity with the service mark.\n6.3 The panel finds that the record does not indicate any rights or legitimate interests to the domain name by Respondent pursuant to paragraph 4(a)(i)Since Respondent admittedly has not used the domain name, Policy 4(c)(ii) and 4(c)(iii) are inapplicableIn Policy 4(c)(i), Respondent could have proven a \"demonstrable preparation to use\", but has not done soThe mere allegation that \"eradio.com\" may be useful in a website development enterprise for generic or descriptive terms is insufficientMoreover, the Panel has indicated that E-RADIO is a registered service mark thus casting further doubt on this allegation.\n6.4 Although the Panel has found that Complainant has satisfied Policy 4(a)(i) and 4(a)(ii), it cannot find bad faith use and registration pursuant to Policy 4(a)(iii) on this recordThe fact that Respondent registered its domain name two (2) years before the intent to use application of Complainant was filed and three (3) years before Complainant started using the mark is persuasive to the Panel that none of the bad faith factors in Policy 4(b) apply.\n6.5 The final issue before the Panel is Reverse Domain Name Hijacking pursuant to Policy 15(e)On the record before the Panel, the Panel cannot find that the Complaint was brought in bad faithThe Complainant owns a trademark registration and is pursuing a dispute resolution proceeding against an identical domain nameAlthough the Panel finds that Complainant has not proven its case, it also does not find any Reverse Domain Name Hijacking on the evidence and pleadings submitted\n  7. Decision\n7.1 The Panel decides that the domain name \"eradio.com\" is identical or confusingly similar to the service mark of Complainant, that Respondent does not have any rights or legitimate interests in such domain name, and that Respondent has not registered or been using the domain name in bad faith.": [

Derechos o intereses leg\u00edtimos\nEl art\u00edculo 1.c de la Pol\u00edtica contempla de forma no exhaustiva las siguientes hip\u00f3tesis demostrativas de derechos e intereses leg\u00edtimos sobre un nombre dominio:\ni. \u201cantes de haber recibido cualquier aviso de la controversia, se ha utilizado el nombre de dominio, o se han efectuado preparativos demostrables para su utilizaci\u00f3n, o un nombre correspondiente al nombre de dominio en relaci\u00f3n con una oferta de buena fe de productos o servicios o bien jur\u00eddicamente tutelado por alguna reserva de derechos;\nii. el titular (en calidad de particular, empresa u otra organizaci\u00f3n) ha sido conocido com\u00fanmente por el nombre de dominio, aun cuando no haya adquirido derechos de marcas de productos o de servicios registrada, aviso comercial registrado, denominaci\u00f3n de origen o reserva de derechos; o\niii. se hace un uso leg\u00edtimo y leal o no comercial del nombre de dominio, sin intenci\u00f3n de desviar a los consumidores de manera equ\u00edvoca o de empa\u00f1ar el buen nombre de la marca de productos o de servicios registrada, aviso comercial registrado, denominaci\u00f3n de origen o reserva de derechos en cuesti\u00f3n con \u00e1nimo de lucro.\u201d\nCon relaci\u00f3n a la falta de derechos e intereses leg\u00edtimos del Titular, la Promovente alega que: el Titular no es conocido por el t\u00e9rmino \u201cgranulox\u201d ni tiene una marca registrada en M\u00e9xico que lo faculte a usar dicho t\u00e9rmino en el comercio; el Titular no cuenta con autorizaci\u00f3n de la Promovente para distribuir y comercializar el aerosol cicatrizante que ostenta la marca GRANULOX; el Titular omite se\u00f1alar en su sitio Web qui\u00e9n es el fabricante del producto al que se aplica la marca GRANULOX, y particularmente cu\u00e1l es la supuesta relaci\u00f3n comercial entre el Titular y la Promovente, ver Oki Data Americas, Inc. v. ASD, Inc., Caso OMPI No. D2001-0903.\nHabida cuenta de que estas alegaciones no fueron refutadas por el Titular y al mismo tiempo resultan veros\u00edmiles a la luz de las constancias que integran el expediente, el Experto presume que el Titular no tiene derechos o intereses leg\u00edtimos en el nombre de dominio en disputa.\nA mayor abundamiento, la elecci\u00f3n y explotaci\u00f3n del nombre de dominio en disputa que es id\u00e9ntico a la marca GRANULOX suponen para el Experto un aprovechamiento indebido de la reputaci\u00f3n que se ha ganado la marca GRANOLUX en el mercado global. Este abuso de la marca de la Promovente le impide al Experto concluir que el Titular realiza una oferta de productos de buena fe conforme a la Pol\u00edtica. Ver Eli Lilly and Company v. Protected Domain Services, Customer ID: NCR-1221337/JM Networks, Caso OMPI No. D2010-1477 (la demandada carece de derechos e intereses leg\u00edtimos porque se aprovech\u00f3 indebidamente de la fama y el \u00e9xito comercial de la marca del demandante al adoptar y usar el nombre de dominio en disputa).\nEn las condiciones arriba apuntadas este Experto arriba a la conclusi\u00f3n de que el Titular no posee derechos o intereses leg\u00edtimos conforme a la Pol\u00edtica.\nDe esta manera se colma el supuesto del art\u00edculo 1.a.ii de la Pol\u00edtica.\nE. Registro o uso de mala fe\nEl art\u00edculo 1.b de la Pol\u00edtica establece de manera enunciativa, mas no limitativa, diversos supuestos de mala fe en el registro o uso de un nombre de dominio en disputa:\ni. \u201ccircunstancias que indiquen que se ha registrado o adquirido el nombre de dominio fundamentalmente con el fin de vender, alquilar o ceder de otra manera el registro del nombre de dominio al promovente, que es el titular de la marca de productos o servicios registrada, un aviso comercial registrado, denominaci\u00f3n de origen o reserva de derechos o a un competidor del promovente, por un valor cierto que supera los costos diversos documentados que est\u00e1n relacionados directamente con el registro del nombre de dominio; o\nii. se ha registrado el nombre de dominio a fin de impedir que el titular de la marca de productos o servicios registrada, aviso comercial registrado, denominaci\u00f3n de origen o reserva de derechos refleje su denominaci\u00f3n un nombre de dominio correspondiente, siempre y cuando el titular haya desarrollado una conducta de esa \u00edndole; o\niii. se ha registrado el nombre de dominio fundamentalmente con el fin de perturbar la actividad comercial de un competidor; o\niv. se ha utilizado el nombre de dominio de manera intencionada con el fin de atraer, con \u00e1nimo de lucro, usuarios de Internet a un sitio Web o a cualquier otro sitio en l\u00ednea, creando la posibilidad de que exista confusi\u00f3n con la denominaci\u00f3n del promovente en cuanto a la fuente, patrocinio, afiliaci\u00f3n o promoci\u00f3n del sitio Web o del sitio en l\u00ednea o de un producto o servicio o bien jur\u00eddicamente tutelado por alguna reserva de derechos que figure en el sitio Web o en el sitio en l\u00ednea.\u201d\nEn t\u00e9rminos generales, la mala fe se produce cuando el titular toma ventaja indebida o abusa de la marca del promovente. Ver secci\u00f3n 3.1 de la Sinopsis de la OMPI 3.0.\nEl Experto hace notar que, a diferencia de la UDRP, la Pol\u00edtica \u00fanicamente requiere que el nombre de dominio en disputa se haya registrado de mala fe o bien se utilice de mala fe para tener por satisfecho el tercer elemento de la acci\u00f3n.\nBajo estas premisas, el Experto estima que el registro del nombre de dominio en disputa fue abusivo porque el Titular eligi\u00f3 un nombre de dominio id\u00e9ntico a un t\u00e9rmino que solo se explica como marca de un producto comercializado por la Promovente a escala global.

Apart from the aforesaid trademark registrations, there are several applications pending in various classes for the trademark HERO and HERO-formative marks in the name of the Complainant.\nThe trademark HERO is well-known and enjoys goodwill and reputation of international character through publicity, dissemination of knowledge and information about the mark and products and services traded. The Complainant has, since its incorporation, spent millions of dollars on the publicity of their goods and sales promotion activities. As a result of such expenditure in terms of time, money and effort, the mark HERO today has become synonymous with the products and services of the Complainant.\nThe Respondent herein has registered the disputed domain name <herohousingfinance.com>.\nThe Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name. The registration and use of the disputed domain name by the Respondent confuses the public to believe that he is associated with the Complainant in some manner, and such use violates the Complainant\u2019s trademark rights.\nThe disputed domain name <herohousingfinance.com> is similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademark as the disputed domain name encapsulates the entire trademark HERO of the Complainant within its domain name in addition to incorporating the corporate name of group company Hero Housing Finance Limited. Adoption of the trademark in the disputed domain name is likely to lead the public to believe that the Complainant is connected with it. The Complainant requests the transfer of the disputed domain name.\nB. Respondent\nThe Respondent had sent an email on October 20, 2017 to the Center stating that the disputed domain name belongs to him and he will renew the same. But he did not file a Response to the (allegations made in the) Complaint.\n6. Discussion and Findings\nAs per paragraph 5(e) of the Rules where a respondent does not submit a response, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the panel may decide the dispute based upon the Complaint. The Panel does not find any exceptional circumstances in this case preventing it from determining the dispute based upon the Complaint, notwithstanding the failure of the Respondent to file a response. As per paragraph 14(b) of the Rules, where a party does not comply with any provision of the Rules, the Panel is to draw such inferences there from as it considers appropriate. It remains incumbent on the Complainant to make out its case in all respects under paragraph 4(a) of the Policy, which sets out the three elements that must be present for the proceeding to be brought against the Respondent, which the Complainant must prove to obtain a requested remedy. It provides as follows:\n\u201c4(a). Applicable Disputes. You are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in the event that a third party (a \u201ccomplainant\u201d) asserts to the applicable Provider, in compliance with the Rules of Procedure, that\n(i) your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and\n(ii) you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and\n(iii) your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\nIn the administrative proceeding, the complainant must prove that each of these three elements are present.\u201d\nThe Panel will address the three aspects of the Policy listed above.\nA. Identical or Confusingly Similar\nThe Complainant has produced registration certificates granted by the Registrar of Trade Marks, in its favour in respect of the trademark HERO, including Indian Trademark No. 235780, with an application date of June 13, 1966 and with a trademark certificate dated May 15, 1970, and Trademark No. 605247, with an application date of August 26, 1993 and with a trademark certificate dated January 17, 2005. The WIPO Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions, Third Edition (\u201cWIPO Overview 3.0\u201d) section 1.7 provides the consensus view of panelists: \u201cWhile each case is judged on its own merits, in cases where a domain name incorporates the entirety of a trademark, or where at least a dominant feature of the relevant mark is recognizable in the domain name, the domain name will normally be considered confusingly similar to that mark for purposes of UDRP standing.\u201d\nThe Respondent has registered the disputed domain name <herohousingfinance.com> wholly incorporating the Complainant\u2019s trademark HERO and also the corporate name of one of the Complainant\u2019s group companies, Hero Housing Finance Limited, which the Panel finds is sufficient to establish confusing similarity for the purpose of the Policy.\nThe Panel finds that the disputed domain name <herohousingfinance.com> is confusingly similar to the trademark HERO.\nB. Rights or Legitimate Interests\nThe Complainant has the burden of establishing that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name <herohousingfinance.com>. Nevertheless, it is well settled that the Complainant needs only to make out a prima facie case, after which the burden of production shifts to the Respondent to rebut such prima facie case by demonstrating rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name.\nThe Respondent has registered the disputed domain name consisting of the trademark HERO. The Complainant and its group companies had been using the trademark for a long time. The Complainant has not authorized or permitted the Respondent to use the trademark HERO.\nParagraph 4(c) of the Policy lists circumstances, in particular but without limitation, which, if found by the Panel to be proved, may demonstrate the respondent\u2019s rights or legitimate interests in a disputed domain name for the purposes of paragraph 4(a)(ii) of the Policy. Section 2.1 of WIPO Overview 3.0 provides: \u201cWhile the overall burden of proof in UDRP proceedings is on the complainant, panels have recognized that proving a respondent lacks rights or legitimate interests in a domain name may result in the often impossible task of \u2018proving a negative\u2019, requiring information that is often primarily within the knowledge or control of the respondent. As such, where a complainant makes out a prima facie case that the respondent lacks rights or legitimate interests, the burden of production on this element shifts to the respondent to come forward with relevant evidence demonstrating rights or legitimate interests in the domain name. If the respondent fails to come forward with such relevant evidence, the complainant is deemed to have satisfied the second element.\u201d\nThe Respondent has failed to file a response to rebut the Complainant\u2019s prima facie case or to explain how the disputed domain name\u2019s resolution to a GoDaddy parking page supports the Respondent\u2019s rights or legitimate interests. See section 2.9 of WIPO Overview 3.0. The Respondent has thus failed to demonstrate any rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name as per paragraph 4(c) of the Policy.\nBased on the facts as stated above, the Panel finds that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain name <herohousingfinance.com>.\nC. Registered and Used in Bad Faith\nParagraph 4(b) of the Policy identifies, in particular but without limitation, four circumstances which, if found by the Panel to be present, shall be evidence of the registration and use of the disputed domain name in bad faith. Each of the four circumstances in paragraph 4(b) of the Policy, if found, is evidence of \u201cregistration and use of a domain name in bad faith\u201d. The Complainant is required to prove both that the disputed domain name was registered in bad faith and that it is being used in bad faith. Hence, circumstances at the time of registration and thereafter have to be considered by the Panel.\nSection 3.1.1 of WIPO Overview 3.0 provides: \u201cIf on the other hand circumstances indicate that the respondent\u2019s intent in registering the disputed domain name was in fact to profit in some fashion from or otherwise exploit the complainant\u2019s trademark, panels will find bad faith on the part of the respondent. While panel assessment remains fact-specific, generally speaking such circumstances, alone or together, include: (i) the respondent\u2019s likely knowledge of the complainant\u2019s rights, (ii) the distinctiveness of the complainant\u2019s mark, (iii) a pattern of abusive registrations by the respondent, (iv) website content targeting the complainant\u2019s trademark, e.g., through links to the complainant\u2019s competitors, (v) threats to point or actually pointing the domain name to trademark-abusive content, (vi) threats to \u201csell to the highest bidder\u201d or otherwise transfer the domain name to a third party, (vii) failure of a respondent to present a credible evidence-backed rationale for registering the domain name, (viii) a respondent\u2019s request for goods or services in exchange for the domain name, (ix) a respondent\u2019s attempt to force the complainant into an unwanted business arrangement, (x) a respondent\u2019s past conduct or business dealings, or (xi) a respondent\u2019s registration of additional domain names corresponding to the complainant\u2019s mark subsequent to being put on notice of its potentially abusive activity.\u201d\nThe Complainant has produced evidence of registration of the trademark HERO in its favour given by the Trademark Registry. The Respondent has registered the disputed domain name recently on September 18, 2016 incorporating in it the trademark HERO of the Complainant (and the corporate name of one of the Complainant\u2019s group companies). The disputed domain name also resolves to a GoDaddy parking page with links related to housing finance, one of the Complainant\u2019s areas of practice. In view of these facts, use of the trademark in the disputed domain name is likely to cause confusion as to source, sponsorship, or affiliation, which constitutes bad faith registration and use under paragraph 4(b)(iv) of the Policy.\nThe Respondent has also listed the disputed domain name <herohousingfinance.com> for sale for USD 29,000. The Complainant has not granted the Respondent permission or a license of any kind to use its trademark and register the disputed domain name <herohousingfinance.com>. Such unauthorized registration and listing of the trademark for sale for USD 29,000 by the Respondent suggests opportunistic bad faith. The Respondent\u2019s true purpose in registering and using the disputed domain name <herohousingfinance.com> which incorporates the entire trademark of the Complainant is, in the Panel\u2019s view, to capitalize on the reputation of the trademark.\nThe Panel therefore finds that the disputed domain name <herohousingfinance.com> has been registered and is being used by the Respondent in bad faith.\n7. Decision\nFor the foregoing reasons, in accordance with paragraphs 4(i) of the Policy and 15 of the Rules, the Panel orders that the disputed domain name, <herohousingfinance.com> be transferred to the Complainant.\n": [

He responded by email dated July 21, 2012, to the effect that the domain name was no longer accessible. On July 31, 2012, Mr. Kuperhand emailed the Center saying that he was \u201ca little baffled by continuing this process especially since I have adhered to the requests and the domain axaadvisorsfinancialinvestments.com is no longer in my possession and has been removed shortly after receiving the initial request.\u201d He replied again simply stating: - \u201cI am not in the business of hiring, I am in the business of partnership\u201d and \u201cmaking money feels good \u2026 but making money by making other people money feels better\u201d. It is apparent from this correspondence that Mr. Kuperhand does not appear to object to the relief sought by the Complainant.\n5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\n1. The Complainant contends that it has registered trademark rights in inter alia the marks AXA, AXA INSURANCE, AXA ADVISORS, AXA FINANCIAL, and AXA INVESTMENT MANAGERS.\n2. It contends that the disputed domain name is confusingly similar to its registered trademark rights and that, terms like \u201cadvisors\u201d, \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201cinvestments\u201d are commonly and descriptively used in the financial advisory market are descriptive.\n3. The Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain name. For the following reasons:\n(a) The name of the Respondent DmarketingKing has no resemblance to the word AXA.\n(b) The Complainant has never licensed or otherwise permitted the Respondent to use its trademarks or to register any domain name including the above mentioned trademarks.\n(c) There is no relationship whatsoever between the parties.\n4. The domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith. The Respondent must undoubtedly have been aware of the risk of deception in registered and using the domain name.\n5. The Respondent has deliberately tried to gain unfair benefit from the Complainant\u2019s reputation by using on its websites such as: \u201cAXA Advisors Financial Investments\u201d and \u201cthe brilliance of AXA Investment Management\u201d.\nB. Respondent\nIn the absence of a formal response from the Respondent there are no factual or legal contentions. The emails received from Mr. Daniel Kuperhand are not in opposition to the Complainant\u2019s contentions.\n6. Discussion and Findings\nA. Identical or Confusingly Similar\nThe Panel finds that the Complainant has registered rights in the trademarks referred to above and in particular in the registered marks AXA, AXA ADVISORS, AXA FINANCIAL and AXA INVESTMENT MANAGERS. It appears to the Panel that the words in the domain name \u201cAdvisors\u201d, \u201cFinancial\u201d and \u201cInvestments\u201d qualify and are descriptive of the predominant part of the domain name which is the word AXA. It follows that the disputed domain name <axaadvisorsfinancialinvestments.com> is confusingly similar to the registered trademarks over which the Complainant has rights. The Complainant succeeds in this element.\nB. Rights on Legitimate Interests\nIt is apparent that there is no similarity whatsoever between the disputed domain name <axaadvisorsfinancialinvestments.com> and the name of the Respondent \u201cDmarketingKing\u201d. Nor is there any evidence that the Complainant licensed or otherwise permitted the Respondent to use its trademarks or to register any domain name including the trademarks. It is therefore apparent that there is no relationship whatsoever between the parties. The Panel therefore finds that the Respondent has clearly registered the Complainant\u2019s trademarks for its own use and incorporated them into its domain name without the Complainant\u2019s authorisation. It follows that the Complainant succeeds on this element.\nC. Registered and Used in Bad Faith\nThe Complainant asserts that the disputed domain name has been registered for the purpose of attracting Internet users to the Respondent\u2019s website and making unfair benefit of its reputation by reproducing the distinctive name AXA with the addition of the generic and descriptive terms \u201cAdvisors\u201d, \u201cFinancial\u201d and \u201cInvestments\u201d. The Panel also accepts the evidence of the Complainant that the Complainant\u2019s trademarks and in particular the distinctive mark AXA are known worldwide. The Complainant refers to an earlier WIPO Case FINAXA v. Managing Trustee/MeridianGlobal, WIPO Case No. D2004-0509, in which an earlier panel recognised the well-known nature of the AXA marks. The Panel therefore accepts that the Respondent must undoubtedly have been aware of the risk of deception and confusion that would inevitably follow when registering the disputed domain name since it could lead Internet users searching for the official AXA websites to the Respondent\u2019s pages <axaadvisorsfinancialinvestments.com>. It follows, and the Panel accepts this, that the disputed domain name was registered in bad faith.\nThe Complainant also at annex 15 to the Complaint produces evidence of the Respondent\u2019s website from which it is plain that the disputed domain name is used as a referral portal which contains a number of hyperlinks offering various kinds of services relating to the Complainants\u2019 trading activity in the field of insurance and financial services. In the Panel\u2019s view it follows that the Respondent is deliberately trying to gain unfair benefit from the Complainant\u2019s reputation by using on its website links referring to financial investment, financial advice and investment management.\nIn these circumstances the Panel is entitled to find and does find that the disputed domain name is also being used in bad faith. It follows that the Panel finds for the Complainant in respect of this element of the Policy.\n7. Decision\nFor all the foregoing reasons, in accordance with paragraphs 4(1) of the Policy and 15 of the Rules, the Panel orders that the disputed domain name <axaadvisorsfinancialinvestments.com> be cancelled, as requested by the Complainant in paragraph 13 of the Complaint.": [

"Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America submitted the Response in this proceeding, as well as three supplemental communications. He uses both \u201cI\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d in referring to ownership of the Domain Name and the website to which it resolves. Heartland Times, LLC is a Nebraska limited liability company, as shown on the business entities database operated by the Nebraska Secretary of State. Mr. Sullivan is listed as the registered agent for the company. An email from Mr. Sullivan to the publishers of Hotel Business, discussed below, suggests that Mr. Sullivan is a \u201cpartner\u201d and \u201cgeneral manager\u201d of Heartland Times, LLC.\nFrom a perusal of the Response and the Respondent\u2019s various websites, it appears that Heartland Times, LLC publishes newsletters, flyers, and websites. The latter feature both text and audio recordings in the form of Internet \u201cradio stations\u201d with both music and \u201ctalk show\u201d formats. In addition to the website associated with the Domain Name, Heartland Times, LLC operates a number of websites, many of which are linked to one another, focused on particular issues. These include \u201cwww.chambersucks.com\u201d, which criticizes the Omaha Chamber of Commerce; \u201cwww.drunkaholic.com\u201d, which publishes information about local drivers who have been arrested for drunk driving; \u201cwww.peerslist.com\u201d, which posts information and derogatory comments about members of the board of directors of the Omaha Public Power District and other persons of whom Mr. Sullivan is critical; \u201cwww.powerloss.com\u201d, which complains about the impact of the Omaha Public Power District constructing utility poles on the property of Mr. Sullivan\u2019s mother; \u201cwww.electmortsullivantooppdboard.com\u201d, which discusses Mr. Sullivan\u2019s 2008 candidacy for the board of directors of the Omaha Public Power District (it appears from material on some of the Respondent\u2019s websites that Mr. Sullivan, \u201cthe true Irish candidate\u201d, also campaigned in 2006 for the offices of governor and lieutenant governor of the State of Nebraska and earlier sought election as mayor of Omaha); \u201cwww.screwthezoo.com\u201d, which advocates a public investigation of the Omaha Zoo Foundation; and \u201cwww.cleanwateractlawsuit.com\u201d, which discusses the possibility of bringing an environmental lawsuit against owners of land on the site of a former landfill in Omaha.\nThe website to which the Domain Name resolves consists of a single, rather lengthy page of information and opinion headed, \u201cHeartland Times, LLC (Heartland\u2019s Common Sense Newspaper) (Internet Cyber-Gripe Web Site)\u201d": [

Wij zijn van mening dat het domein door de huidige bezitters te kwader trouw is geregistreerd, met de volledige bedoeling om de registratie te verkopen, aan een bedrijf, zoals de onze, met een legitieme juridische en commerci\u00eble reden voor het verkrijgen van de registratie.\"\nB.

"Staffords, Drinagh Co. Wexford. The status of non-proprietal warehouse keeper is not afforded to a trader unless they can prove to the satisfaction of the Irish Revenue Commissioners that they import sufficiently large quantities of stock. The Respondent imports champagne only and by extension therefore, this shows the Respondent imports substantial quantities of champagne into Ireland (emphasis supplied).\nThe Respondent contends that he supplies champagne both to the public and to trade clients through importation and reselling including the reselling champagnes and wines imported by other Irish wine importers. The Respondent is proud to supply some of Ireland\u2019s most famous restaurants with champagne only (emphasis supplied).\nOver the last 4 years, the Respondent has entered a large number of champagnes from four separate champagne houses, in the wind guide, A&A Farmar\u2019s Best of Wine in Ireland (the definitive Irish Wine Guide). The Respondent states that it will also be seen from the Respondent\u2019s entries in this guide that he has only included champagnes and has never entered any of its wines. This again demonstrates the emphasis placed by the Respondent on promoting and selling champagnes above all other champagne wines.\nThe Respondent says he owns one other website established at the <champers.ie> domain name. On this website he offers for sale champagnes only using an online ordering and payment system which the Respondent has had installed, the Respondent plans to include all the other champagnes which the Respondent currently sells.\nThe Respondent says he is moving away from the party planning and catering sector and plans to combine his websites for the online sale of a large range of champagnes in early 2008.\nThe Respondent submits that he purchased the domain name <champagne.ie> in September 2004, originally as an additional address for his existing champagne business.\nDuring 2005, the Respondent began offering ancillary party planning services through contacts built up by supplying champagnes and wines to parties. The Respondent therefore began promoting these ancillary services on the website.\nThe Respondent states that he paid over \u20ac3,000 in graphic design fees, website hosting fees, directory advertising \u20ac1,243.88. He has used the goodwill that he has built up as a champagne trader to promote the website by word of mouth. It follows that prior to receiving notice of this dispute in 2007, the Respondent used the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of goods and services, in this case champagne, wines and ancillary party planning services.\nThe Respondent contends that by using his website to sells champagne and promote the sales of a business which specialises in the sale of champagnes above all other wines the Respondent can not be said to \u201cdilute the reputation of champagne\u201d.\nThe growth of champagne around the world depends on importers and distributors around the world investing their capital in champagne stock and investing their time and money in selling champagne. Those who validly represent a number of champagne houses in Ireland as agents must also by extension enjoy rights in Champagne. By his own hard work in cold calling to restaurants and wine shops and by investing money in his promotional campaigns the Respondent has built up a solid client base.\nTherefore, the Respondent, in his capacity as a legitimate, licensed champagne importer with a business established over four years, must be considered as having a legitimate interest in Champagne.\nAddressing the Complainant\u2019s allegation that the domain name has been registered or is being used in bad faith, the Respondent submits that he is the holder of a valid excise license and is a non-proprietal warehouse keeper. He has sold and promoted champagne since 2003 and it follows that he has a direct interest in the trade of champagne.\nThe Respondent denies the Complainant\u2019s claim that the Respondent has used the domain name to \u201clure\u201d customers onto his website with the \u201cfalse promise\u201d of finding champagnes, and that if a user were to type in and search \u201cchampagne\u201d on the Internet, a website selling champagnes and wines is \u201ccertainly not what users would expect\u201d. The Respondent submits that this is a completely inaccurate statement. A simple search for the word \u201cchampagne\u201d on <google.co.uk> shows clearly that of nine first page results (excluding Wikipedia), five results relate to online offerings of both wines and champagnes. In other words, 55% relate to offerings which the Respondent claims users \u201cwould not expect\u201d. Similarly of eight sponsored links on <google.co.uk>, under a search of the word \u201cchampagne\u201d, eight relate to online offerings of wines and champagnes. In other words, 100% of sponsored links relate to offerings which, according to the Complainant, users \u201cwould not expect\u201d. This clearly demonstrates that users enter the word \u201cchampagne\u201d on search engines in the reasonable expectation of finding a website offering champagnes and wines for sale.\nThe Respondent contends that the Complainant\u2019s assertion that the user would type in <champagne.ie> in the expectation of finding an information site relating to champagnes does not hold water. This may be true for global level domains such as .com, .net, .biz etc., but surely when one types <champagne.ie> into the Internet it is because they are an Irish consumer who wishes to purchase champagne from an Irish champagne agent and not merely find out information.\nThe Respondent purchased the domain name in September 2004. It should be obvious that as an established and licensed champagne importer and distributor since 2003, the Respondent registered the domain name in good faith to support his existing business of selling champagne wines.\nWhile the domain name was purchased initially as an additional address for the Respondent\u2019s existing online offering, the Respondent however subsequently began offering ancillary activities of party planning. The Respondent therefore decided to include said ancillary and complimentary services on the website. These ancillary party planning and promotional activities were not a commercial success. The Respondent therefore decided to gradually withdraw from the party planning business and concentrate on his champagne and wine business.\nDue to financial pressure, and in order to recoup the financial losses sustained in the party planning business, the Respondent reluctantly decided to sell the domain name in late 2006. The Respondent submits that it should be obvious that the value of the domain name <champagne.ie> is high to the Respondent as a bona fide champagne and wine importer and distributor as it matches the primary product that the Respondent would have been offering. Therefore, in his valuation of the domain name, the Respondent took into account the present value of such lost future earnings as well as graphic design costs circa \u20ac3,000, advertising \u20ac1,243.88, three years worth of registrations and the goodwill built up by the Respondent through his own marketing of the website.\nThe Respondent submits that a domain name is not an easy asset to value and as the Respondent has never before sold a domain name, accordingly he found it difficult to place a value on the domain name in dispute. Given the responses to the Respondent\u2019s initial offer, he realised that the value he had placed on the domain name was substantially more than interested parties were willing to pay. A lengthy exchange of emails followed in which the Complainant continued to offer to \u201creimburse\u201d the Respondent with up to a maximum of \u20ac1,000 and consistently threatened the Complainant with legal action. This completely arbitrary figure of \u20ac1,000 is one which the Complainant has taken it upon itself to define as \u201ca proper price\u201d.\nThe Respondent has accordingly had to give up a substantial amount of his time in November, 2006, which is essentially the Respondent\u2019s busiest month for champagne sales. This was a situation which the Respondent would have wished to avoid as it has cost him time and money. It is for this reason that the Respondent sent the final email.\nOne year on from the Respondent\u2019s initial decision to sell the domain name, the financial issues he faced are no longer the same and consequently the Respondent no longer wishes to sell the domain name.\nThe Respondent intends to proceed with his original intention to use the domain name to promote the online sale of champagnes with his other website at the \u201cwww.champers.ie\u201d address.\n  6. Discussion and Findings\nParagraph 1 of the IEDR Policy places on the Complainants the obligation to prove that:\n1.1.1 the domain name at issue is identical or misleadingly similar to a Protected Identifier in which the Complainant has rights; and\n1.1.2 the Respondents have no rights in law or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name at issue; and\n1.1.3 the domain name at issue has been registered or is being used in bad faith.\nParagraph 1.3.1 of the IEDR Policy provides that \u201cProtected Identifiers for the purpose of this Policy are:\n1.3.1 trade and service marks protected in the island of Ireland.\n1.3.2 personal names (including pseudonyms) in which the Complainant has acquired a reputation in the island of Ireland.\n1.3.3 geographical indications that can prima facie be protected in the island of Ireland. Geographical indications are, for the purposes of this Policy, indications which identify a good as originating in a territory or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin. A Complainant is deemed to have rights in a geographical indication for the purposes of this Policy, if it has standing to bring an action based on the alleged infringement of the geographical indication before the courts of Ireland.\nA. Identical or Confusingly Similar\nIs the word \u201cchampagne\u201d a Protected Identifier for the Purposes of the IEDR Policy? Paragraph 1.3 of the IEDR Policy defines Protected Identifiers as including \u201cgeographical indications that can prima facie be protected in the island of Ireland. Geographical indications are, for the purposes of this Policy, indications which identify a good as originating in a territory or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.\u201d\nIn the Complaint, and in the response to the Procedural Order, the Complainant\u2019s submissions unfortunately focus on rights in France and other jurisdictions, rather than Ireland. Champagne is undoubtedly a famous designation of origin, but that is not sufficient to satisfy the IEDR Policy. The IEDR Policy requires that a designation of origin must be prima facie protected in either or both of the jurisdictions of Ireland.\nThe Complainant continuously claims that Champagne is a registered appellation of origin but has not provided any evidence of any registration in either of the jurisdictions in Ireland. In particular there is no evidence that the word \u201cchampagne\u201d has been registered as a Certification Trade Mark or a Collective Trade Mark.\nThe Complainant relies on the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1493/1999 of May 17, 1999 and in particular Articles 41-44, 50 and 54 thereof. It is difficult to understand how any of these provisions create rights for the producers of Champagnes in either jurisdiction in Ireland and despite having been specifically requested so to do, the Complainant has not adequately addressed this issue. The provisions in Articles 41-44 relate to the implementation of marketing rules by producer Member States to give effect to decisions of \u201csectoral organisations\u201d and \u0153nological production regulations. Article 50 expressly refers to wines from \u201cthird countries\u201d as distinct from other member states of the Community. Article 54 sets out rules relating to the production of quality wines in specific regions.\nNonetheless the Complainant has referred to an English authority that accepts that the Complainant has standing to bring an action in passing off. This authority has persuasive standing in an Irish court.\nThe Panel notes that under the IEDR Policy the Complainant is only required to establish a \u201cprima facie\u201d case that the geographical indication can be protected in Irish law and as the Complainant has made out a prima facie case that the word \u201cchampagne\u201d is protectable under the Irish law of passing off, the Complainant has succeeded in establishing that the designation of origin CHAMPAGNE is a Protected Identifier for the purposes of the IEDR Policy.\nDoes the Complainant have rights in the Protected Identifier for the purposes of the IEDR Policy? Paragraph 1.3.3 of the Policy states that \u201ca Complainant is deemed to have rights in a geographical indication for the purposes of this Policy, if it has standing to bring an action based on the alleged infringement of the geographical indication before the courts of Ireland.\u201d\nThe Complainant was created in France by the law of April 12, 1941 modified by the laws of June 2, 1944, June 7, 1977, June 23, 2005 and January 5, 2006": [

Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\nThe Complainant states that the disputed domain names at issue are confusingly similar to the BRADESCO trademark, to which the Complainant has rights. Furthermore, domain names are composed by the Complainant\u2019s trademark \u201cBRADESCO\u201d preceded by a letter \u201ci\u201d, which is not able to distinguish said domain names from the Complainant\u2019s trademark.\nThe Complainant states that there is no trademark registered, in the name of the Respondent that consists of, or contains, the word \u201cbradesco\u201d. The Complainant has not entered into any agreement, authorization or license with the Respondent with respect to the use of the word \u201cbradesco\u201d.\nThe Complainant also states that the expression \u201cbradesco\u201d is a coined word created by the joining of the first letters of the Complainant\u2019s previous commercial name (Banco BRAsileiro de DESCOntos).\nThe Complainant alleges that Respondent\u2019s activities do not relate to the products commercialized under the BRADESCO trademark and Respondent has never been known to be related or associated to said mark.\nThe Complainant further alleges that there is no active webpage related to the disputed domain names, it is possible to infer that the only plausible explanation for the Respondent\u2019s selection of the disputed domain names is to exploit in an unauthorized fashion the reputation and goodwill of the Complainant and its names and marks. The trademark BRADESCO is so widely used and known by the public that it would be almost impossible for someone to claim having registered said mark as a domain name, had it not been in absolute bad faith.\nThe Complainant finally indicates that Complainant has established and proven that the three requirements of paragraphs 4(a)(i)(ii)(iii) of the Policy have been met in the present case, i.e.: that the disputed domain names <i-bradesco.com>, <i-bradesco.net>, <ibradesco.info> and <i-bradesco.org> are confusingly similar to Complainant\u2019s BRADESCO trademark, and domain names; that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain names that are the subject of the Complaint, and that the registration and use of the disputed domain names have been made by the Respondent in clear bad faith.\nB.

"Banco de Santander, S.A. y Banca Serf\u00edn, S.A. Grupo Financiero, son titulares de los registros 335810 y 548496 respectivamente. El primero ampara \u201cservicios prestados en asuntos financieros, bancarios y otras instituciones de cr\u00e9dito, as\u00ed como en relaci\u00f3n con toda clase de contratos de seguros, especialmente servicios de finanzas\u201d y el segundo seguros y finanzas.\nb) Ambos se encuentran vigentes y surtiendo sus efectos legales, por lo que tienen el derecho al uso exclusivo sobre las denominaciones y con ello impedir que se utilicen, en este caso, como identificadores que pueden inducir a error o confusi\u00f3n al p\u00fablico consumidor.\nc) Por otra parte, el Demandado al no dar contestaci\u00f3n de la demanda, no acredita tener derecho alguno sobre el nombre de dominio en disputa y de las constancias exhibidas por las Demandantes se desprende que es a \u00e9stas a quienes les corresponde el derecho sobre las denominaciones SANTANDER y SERFIN.\n  7. Registro del Nombre de dominio de Mala Fe\nDe las constancias del expediente, se desprende que el nombre de dominio se registr\u00f3 de mala fe, pues el demandado, con base en las actividades que realiza, debe tener conocimiento de la existencia de la marca SERFIN en M\u00e9xico, propiedad de Banca Serf\u00edn, S.A. Grupo Financiero desde muchos a\u00f1os antes de que se llevara a cabo la operaci\u00f3n, por virtud de la cual se form\u00f3 el Grupo Santander Serf\u00edn.\nDe la misma manera, una vez anunciada la operaci\u00f3n por virtud de la cual Sandander Investment Bank adquiri\u00f3 el Grupo Serf\u00edn, el Panel considera que se le dio una amplia difusi\u00f3n a esta transacci\u00f3n mercantil, para informar a todo el p\u00fablico, en el que est\u00e1 comprendido el Demandado, lo que hace pensar al Panel que el registro del nombre de dominio se hizo con el fin de aprovecharse del prestigio de las dos instituciones financieras, por lo que el Panel considera que existi\u00f3 mala fe en el registro del mismo.\nPor otra parte, del an\u00e1lisis de las constancias presentadas por la parte demandante, se desprende que hubo un acercamiento entre las partes para la cesi\u00f3n del nombre de dominio, sin embargo, las pretensiones de la parte demandada, sin fijar una cantidad, exced\u00edan de lo que ser\u00eda un pago razonable por los gastos incurridos en el registro del dominio, lo que hace pensar al Panel que se hizo con el fin de venderlo o transferirlo al titular de las marcas en cuesti\u00f3n o que se registr\u00f3 con el fin de impedir que el titular de la marca lo pudiera utilizar como nombre de dominio, por lo que el Panel considera que a\u00fan y cuando el dominio, tal como se\u00f1ala la parte demandante, se encuentra suspendido, eso no es un elemento suficiente para negar el hecho de que hizo y se ha usado de mala fe.\nPor otra parte, el Demandado al no contestar la demanda, no acredita ning\u00fan uso del dominio, ni acredita que su negociaci\u00f3n est\u00e9 com\u00fanmente denominada por ese dominio, sino que de las constancias que aparecen en el expediente, el Panel considera que con el nombre de dominio el Demandado pretende enga\u00f1ar al p\u00fablico consumidor y obtener una ganancia comercial al registrar el mismo.\n  8. Decisi\u00f3n\nPor las razones expuestas en conformidad con los p\u00e1rrafos 4.i) de la Pol\u00edtica y 15 del Reglamento, el Panel ordena que el nombre de dominio <santanderserfin.com> sea transferido a Banco Santander Mexicano, S.A.": [

"San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sudan, Switzerland, Ukraine, Viet Nam, Montenegro, Italy and Serbia; and\n- United States of America trademark number 74345754, for AMBIEN, filed on January 5, 1993 and registered on December 7, 1993 in class 5.\nComplainant is also the owner of the following domain names:\n- <ambien.com> registered on April 12, 2000;\n- <ambien.eu> registered on July 2, 2006;\n- <ambien.fr> registered on May 30, 2002;\n- <ambien.us> registered on April 19, 2002;\n- <ambien.net> registered on April 12, 2000;\n- <ambien.info> registered on August 24, 2001;\n- <ambien.org> registered on April 12, 2000;\n- <ambien.mobi> registered on August 2, 2006; and\n- <ambien.us> registered on April 19, 2002.\nComplainant notes that the above-mentioned trademarks and domain names were registered prior to November 8, 2017, the registration date of the disputed domain name. According to the evidence provided by Complainant the disputed domain name redirects to a website at \u201cwww.toprxonlinemeds24.com\u201d purporting to offer AMBIEN products for sale alongside those of Complainant\u2019s competitors.\n5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\nComplainant contends that the disputed domain name is confusingly similar to Complainant\u2019s registered trademarks and domain names. The product Complainant sells under the AMBIEN mark is a well-established sleeping aid. The addition of the term \u201cgeneric\u201d placed before AMBIEN in the disputed domain name, and the generic Top-Level Domain (\u201cgTLD\u201d) extension \u201c.club,\u201d is insufficient to alleviate the confusing similarity between Complainant\u2019s trademarks, its domain names and the disputed domain name; indeed, Complainant contends that the addition of the term \u201cgeneric\u201d only increases the risk of confusion.\nComplainant contends that Respondent does not have any rights or legitimate interests regarding the disputed domain name. Complainant has never licensed or otherwise authorized Respondent to use its marks. Complainant contends that \u201cWhoisGuard Protected\u201d or \u201cWhoisGuard, Inc.,\u201d the registrant of the disputed domain name as indicated on the WhoIs database, is not the real registrant. WhoisGuard, Inc. is a service provided by the Registrar which allows its clients to register domain names in its name and on behalf of third parties in order to keep the true identity of the registrant secret. Therefore, Respondent does not have any legitimate interest in using the disputed domain name since the name \u201cWhoisGuard, Inc.\u201d does not bear any resemblance to the word \u201cAMBIEN\u201d. Further, Respondent is not using the disputed domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services, so as to confer a right or legitimate interest in it in accordance with paragraph 4(c)(i) of the Policy. Rather, the disputed domain name leads to a competing website, providing inaccurate information about Complainant, and giving the misleading impression of a relationship between Complainant and Respondent.\nLastly, Complainant contends that Respondent was clearly aware of Complainant\u2019s distinctive and well-known AMBIEN mark when registering the disputed domain name. The disputed domain name leads to a website offering AMBIEN products for sale. By clicking on the \u201cAMBIEN\u201d products listed in \u201cBestsellers\u201d section, the Internet user is redirected to a page through which it can buy AMBIEN products. Respondent has intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to a competing website, by creating a likelihood of confusion with Complainant\u2019s mark and company name as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of Respondent\u2019s website or other location, constituting evidence of bad faith.\nB.

"Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Zambia, etc. In most of the countries the said trademark is registered in Class 28. However, in certain countries it is also registered in some other Classes including Classes 3, 9, 14, 16, 20, 24, 25, 38, 41 and 42. A detailed list of the countries where the trademark LEGO is registered and the class in which it is registered is provided by the Complainant.\nThe Complainant has contended that all four of the disputed domain names, that is, <legominecraftcreeper.com>, <legominecraftnether.com>, <legominecraftsets.com> and <legominecraftvillage.com> include its trademark LEGO. Thus, the disputed domain names are identical or confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademark LEGO.\nThe Complainant further contends that it is the owner of more than 2,400 domain names containing the word \u201cLego\u201d and it is the strict policy of the Complainant that all domain names containing the word \u201cLego\u201d should be owned by the Complainant.\nAnyone who sees the disputed domain names may believe that they are the domain names of the Complainant or that they are associated with it or have some kind of commercial relationship with the Complainant. Therefore, the likelihood of confusion cannot be ruled out.\nIn relation to the second element, that is, that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain names, the Complainant contends that the Respondent has never registered the LEGO trademark or any similar trademark. The Respondent (as an individual, business, or other organization) has not been commonly known by the disputed domain names <legominecraftcreeper.com>, <legominecraftnether.com>, <legominecraftsets.com> and <legominecraftvillage.com>. According to the Registrar, the Respondent is Duy Nguyen.\nThe Complainant has not given any license or authorization to use the trademark LEGO to the Respondent. The Respondent is not an authorized dealer of the Complainant\u2019s products and never had a business relationship with the Complainant. Further, the Respondent is neither making a legitimate or fair use of the disputed domain names, nor is it using the disputed domain names in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services. The websites to which the disputed domain names resolve display sponsored links to \u201cAmazon.com\u201d online sale of toys. The websites are part of the Amazon associate programme and designed to earn advertising fees by linking to \u201cAmazon.com\u201d. Further, the Respondent links to the online shop \u201cwww.amazon.com\u201d not only sell the trademark holders products but also sells products from other companies including competing products. It is contended that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names.\nThus, the Respondent registered the disputed domain names for the sole purpose of creating confusion and misleading the general public and the customers of the Complainant.\nRegarding the third element, that is, that the disputed domain names have been registered and are being used in bad faith, the Complainant contends that the main reason of registering the disputed domain names <legominecraftcreeper.com>, <legominecraftnether.com>, <legominecraftsets.com> and <legominecraftvillage.com> by the Respondent was to earn profit and to mislead the general public and the customers of the Complainant. The Respondent is not an authorized reseller and the websites connect to the online store associated with \u201cAmazon.com\u201d. It does not make a bona fide commercial offering of good or services. The Complainant has contended that the use of a domain name that incorporates a well-known trademark to promote competing or infringing products cannot be considered a \u201cbona fide offering of goods and services\u201d.\nB.

Bel Arbor / Domain Admin, PrivacyProtect.org, Caso OMPI No. D2012-0875; Ver tambi\u00e9n F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG v. Bargin Register, Inc. - Client Services, Caso OMPI No. D2012-0474.\n5 Caso OMPI No. D2001-0121.\n6 Caso OMPI No. D2001-0121 (\u201cIs the Respondent required to adduce any such evidence, if the onus is on the Complainant to prove the three elements of paragraph 4 of the Policy? While the overall burden of proof is on the Complainant, this element involves the Complainant proving matters, which are peculiarly within the knowledge of the Respondent. It involves the Complainant in the often impossible task of proving a negative. In the Panel\u2019s view the correct approach is as follows: the Complainant makes the allegation and puts forward what he can in support (e.g. he has rights to the name, the Respondent has no rights to the name of which he is aware, he has not given any permission to the Respondent). Unless the allegation is manifestly misconceived, the Respondent has a case to answer and that is where paragraph 4(c) of the Policy comes in. If the Respondent then fails to demonstrate his rights or legitimate interests in respect of the Domain Name, the complaint succeeds under this head\u201d).\n7 See Do The Hustle, LLC v.

In addition, the Bharti Group also has mobile operations in Jersey and Guernsey.\nBharti Group has been involved in diversified businesses from manufacturing bicycles, to telecom, insurance and now into emerging business areas in the fast growing reality and retail sectors in India. Bharti Group has partnered with some of the biggest Corporate houses around the world such as Walmart in the retail business; SingTel, Qatar Foundation Endowment, IBM, Ericsson, Nokia, Siemens and Alcatel-Lucent in the telecom business; AXA in the insurance business; and Del Monte Pacific in the foods businesses to provide products and services in India, Asia and abroad.

Consumers around the world, particularly in Asia and Africa, exclusively associate the Mark with the Bharti Group and specific business such as telecom, insurance etc., under the Mark BHARTI along with its group of companies such as the Complainant No. 2 herein. The degree of recognition and association of the word \"Bharti\" with the Complainant and the Bharti Group is evidenced by the fact that a Google search for \"Bharti\" predominantly reveals links to the Complainant and the Bharti Group.\nThe Complainant further claims that it spends millions of dollars each year to promote and advertise the Mark around the world. The Complainant No. 2 is a regular sponsor of cricket matches in India that are watched by over a billion people around the world; have entered into sponsorship deals with world famous soccer clubs like Manchester United; and are also official sponsors for Formula 1 racing. The Complainant's activities establish the immense reputation and recognition of the Mark around the world. The Complainant's extensive global advertising, marketing and use of the Mark establishes its worldwide reputation and goodwill under common law.\nThe Bharti Group has also acquired statutory rights in the Mark through registration of the trademark BHARTI in India in the Complainants name since 2001.\nThe Complainant No. 1 is also the registered proprietor of the Mark BHARTI in various countries like Madagascar, Mozambique, Kenya, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Zambia, Nigeria, the African Intellectual Property Organization (\"OAPI\") member countries and Ethiopia.

The Disputed Domain Name resolves to a website where counterfeit MONTE-CARLO bottles of vodka can be purchased; and\n(vi) the Respondent is not making a fair use of the Disputed Domain Name but is using it to mislead consumers on the identity of the owner of the Website and the origin of the Vodka.

"Hsinchu, Tainan, North Kaohsiung (Dashun), TaoYuan and Chiayi. Beginning in 1997, COSTCO trademark adopted a Chinese equivalent of the COSTCO mark for use in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong \u2013 \u597d\u5e02\u591a. These characters are pronounced as \u201chow she dough\u201d and are written in English as \u201cHao Shih Do\u201d and will be referred to herein as HAO SHIH DO. HAO SHIH DO is the Chinese equivalent of COSTCO and is used to mean \u201cCostco\u201d whenever and wherever the COSTCO trademark is to be written in Chinese characters. Through Price Costco International, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, the Complainants have registered the COSTCO and HAO SHIH DO marks in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong for a variety of goods and services, including especially retail store services.\nThe Respondent registered the disputed domain name on June 23, 2011.\n5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\nThe Complainants contend that the disputed domain name is identical to their well-known and distinctive COSTCO trademarks on the following grounds:\n1. The <costcotw.info> domain name consists of the well\u2010known registered trademark, COSTCO, and \u201ctw\u201d, the country code abbreviation for Taiwan.\n2. The addition of a country code abbreviation such as \u201ctw\u201d to the COSTCO trademark does not mitigate the confusing similarity between the disputed domain name and the COSTCO trademarks. This is supported by numerous prior UDRP decisions involving the COSTCO trademarks.\n3. Because the Complainants have operated in Taiwan since 1997 and have ten warehouse stores in Taiwan that sell a wide variety of products, the addition of \u201ctw\u201d, the country code for Taiwan, to the COSTCO trademark exacerbates the confusing similarity between the COSTCO trademarks and the disputed domain name and increases the risk of confusion between the disputed domain name and the COSTCO trademarks.\nThe Complainants contend that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain name on the following grounds:\n1. The Respondent has no legitimate interest in any domain name, trademark or trade name incorporating or confusingly similar to the COSTCO trademark, has not used the disputed domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services, owns no trademark registrations for the disputed domain name or any portion thereof, and has not been commonly known by the disputed domain name or any portion thereof.\n2. The Complainants have not licensed or otherwise permitted the Respondent to use their marks or the disputed domain name.\n3. The Respondent does not own and cannot lawfully obtain any trademark or intellectual property rights in the COSTCO trademark or any words or phrases that incorporate or are confusingly similar to the COSTCO trademark.\n4. Nevertheless, the Respondent registered the disputed domain name and uses it to direct Internet traffic to its website. The Respondent\u2019s action evidences a clear intent to disrupt the Complainants\u2019 business, deceive consumers, and trade off of the Complainants\u2019 goodwill by creating an unauthorized association between it and the COSTCO trademarks.\nThe Complainants contend that the disputed domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith on the following grounds:\n1. The Respondent\u2019s choice of domain name was not a coincidence. COSTCO is a trademark coined by Costco\u2019s founders in 1983 and lawfully registered and used only by the Complainants. The Complainants received trademark registrations for the COSTCO trademark as early as 1985. The COSTCO trademark became famous a long time ago as its sales grew rapidly from USD 4.1 billion in 1990 to USD 102 billion in fiscal year 2013. The Respondent registered the disputed domain name <costcotw.info> on June 23, 2011, many years after the COSTCO trademark had become famous. Furthermore the Complainants have operated in Taiwan since 1997 and currently have ten warehouse stores there with over 2 million authorized cardholders. Because of the notoriety of the COSTCO trademark in Taiwan, the Respondent must have been aware of Complainants\u2019 rights in the COSTCO trademark when it registered the disputed domain name and when it put it to use diverting Internet users to its website. The Respondent\u2019s prior awareness of the COSTCO trademark is confirmed by his use of the HAO SHI DUO mark on the website at the disputed domain name. Awareness of another\u2019s rights in a mark or domain name at the time of registration is evidence of bad faith registration.\n2. The Respondent\u2019s registration of the disputed domain name was done in bad faith because it had no legitimate right or business interest in any COSTCO\u2010formative domain name. The Respondent\u2019s only conceivable business purposes in registering the disputed domain name was to profit from the diversion of Internet users to his own retail website unrelated to and in competition with the Complainants. This is unmistakably bad faith registration of the disputed domain name.\n3. The Respondent\u2019s use of the disputed domain name to divert Internet traffic to a retail website in direct competition with the Complainants proves the Respondent\u2019s intention to disrupt the Complainants\u2019 business by diverting potential customers of the Complainants to the Respondent\u2019s retail website.\n4. The Respondent uses the disputed domain name to divert Internet users looking for the Complainants to a retail website for its own commercial benefit. This confuses and deceives Internet users, damages the Complainants\u2019 business and reputation, and provides an illicit commercial benefit to the Respondent by trading on the Complainants\u2019 reputation and goodwill. In addition, even if all the branded products for sale on the Respondent\u2019s website are genuine, any consumer criticism of the Respondent\u2019s website or other negative publicity on conventional media and social media sites will undoubtedly harm the Complainants\u2019 excellent reputation.\n5. In view of the uniqueness and fame of the COSTCO trademark and the Respondent\u2019s intention to register and use a domain name based on the COSTCO trademark purely for his own commercial gain, the Respondent\u2019s use of the disputed domain name is inescapably in bad faith. The Respondent does not use the disputed domain name in any legitimate, good faith manner, and there is no legitimate, good faith use of the disputed domain name possible by the Respondent.\nB.

"Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tangier Zone, Tunisia, Turkey, United Kingdom and Yemen.\nIn addition, Complainants state that QVC, Inc. is the registrant of hundreds of QVC formative domain names. These include top level domains and country code domains. They include domain names that are critical to QVC's national and international business, and even include domain names which QVC has no intention of using but has obtained to protect its own reputation (i.e., <adultqvc.com>).\n  5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainants\nComplainants contend as follows:\n(1) The confusing similarity of the disputed domain names and respondent\u2019s bad faith registration and use of them\nIn October, 2000, long after QVC had achieved recognition as an electronic in-home shopping network via television and the Internet, Respondent registered the four Domain Names. Respondent has no license from Complainants nor any other relationship with Complainants or any affiliates of Complainants. Respondent is using the four Domain Names in connection with electronic in-home shopping.\nThe four infringing Domain Names are confusingly similar on their face to the famous and well-respected QVC marks used in connection with electronic in home shopping. They all include the QVC mark in toto as the key element of the Domain Name. The QVC portion of the Domain Names are prefaced by the descriptive generic phrases 'just like' and 'as seen on' in hyphenated form and also without spaces between the letters. The addition of these generic terms and the addition of \".com\" is legally insufficient to avoid a finding of confusing similarity. It is certain that any consumer observing any of the four infringing Domain Names would believe those names and sites had some association with or sponsorship by Complainants.\nUnder the Policy, Paragraph 4(b)(iv), a respondent\u2019s bad faith is established by a showing that by use of the infringing domain name, the respondent has intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to its website by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant\u2019s mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of the respondent\u2019s website or a product offered on such site.\nThere can be no question that Respondent, by using 'just like' and 'as seen on' in connection with Complainants\u2019 QVC mark, has committed conduct that fits squarely within the Policy\u2019s established definition of bad faith. Respondent\u2019s use for commercial gain of <justlikeqvc.com> and <asseenonqvc.com> and their hyphenated versions for the exact same services provided by QVC, Inc. under its famous mark, constitutes bad faith of the highest order.\nBy the time Respondent registered its four QVC formative Domain Names, Complainants\u2019 QVC marks had achieved such distinction that no one would have selected it without having the bad faith intention to trade off Complainants\u2019 rights.\nAdditional evidence of Respondent\u2019s bad faith is the fact that it has registered four different infringing Domain Names to widen its sweep of unwary QVC customers. If Respondent\u2019s intent was to engage in a good faith home shopping service, it could have selected from a myriad of domain names that would not be confusingly similar to the QVC marks.\n(2) There is no evidence that Respondent had any prior rights in any QVC formative mark\nIn late 2000, Complainants informed Respondent of their position about its offending use (See Annex J), but Respondent has never responded to Complainants\u2019 letters nor given any explanation of any legitimate rights it has in QVC or any QVC formative marks. These communications were sent by e-mail and also by courier, return receipt requested. The return receipts indicate the communications were delivered.\nThe facts discussed above further buttress Respondent\u2019s lack of any legitimate rights in any QVC formative mark. There is no evidence that Respondent ever used or had any connection with any QVC formative mark or domain name prior to registering the infringing Domain Names in October 2000. This was years after Complainants\u2019 QVC mark had become famous and at a time when no one would have elected to use QVC in connection with electronic home shopping except with a bad faith attempt to profit from Complainants\u2019 rights.\nB.

Respondent\nRespondent consents to the remedy requested by the Complainant for all Domain Names which are in dispute here, except for the transfer of <arevaservice.com> and <arevaservices.com>. Respondent explains that it realized only after registration that ICANN policies consider multiple registrations as evidence of bad faith and it is willing to give up 15 of its disputed registrations.\nAs to the remaining Domain Names <arevaservice.com> and <arevaservices.com>, Respondent agrees that they contain the trademark AREVA and thus are identical or confusingly similar to Complainant's trademark. However, Respondent alleges that it has rights and legitimate interests in these Domain Names. Respondent points out that it carries out a legitimate business activity, providing electrical testing and field engineering services for over 30 years. It has routinely used the trademark AREVA to describe one brand of electrical products that are serviced by Respondent. The fact that the Domain Names resolved to Respondent's website did not confuse average consumers because customers of Respondent were always aware that they obtained services from Respondent.\nRespondent emphasizes that it does not use the Domain Names as trademarks but simply directs traffic to its website where its genuine services are advertized. Moreover, Respondent alleges that Complainant already uses its trademark in several domain names which proves that Complainant is not deprived from reflecting the trademark in a domain name. The fact that some Domain Names resolve to a parking page rather than to Respondent's web is no evidence of bad faith. Respondent instructed that the Domain Names be directed to a parking page until the end of this dispute. Finally, Respondent mentions that it is entitled to use Complainant's trademark for aftermarket services in an accurate and descriptive way according to US Law.\n6. Discussion and Findings\nA. Respondent's Consent to Transfer Selected Domain Names\nThe first question to be decided by the Panel is the appropriate course of action to be taken regarding the following Domain Names that Respondent agrees to transfer to Complainant: <arevaelectrical.com>, <arevaelectric.com>, <arevaenergy.com>, <arevaengineer.com>, <arevainc.com>, <arevaonline.com>, <arevaparts.com>, <arevapowersystem.com>, <arevapowersystems.com>, <arevarelay.com>, <arevarepair.com>, <arrevaelectrical.com>, <arrevaelectric.com>, <partsareva.com>, <serviceareva.com>.": [],

"Great Britain and Northern Ireland (\u201cUnited Kingdom\u201d). It provides members of the public in the United Kingdom with information and guidance in relation to their pension arrangements and disputes. Its services are provided by a network of volunteers and a London based technical and administrative staff. Though a private entity, its operations are subsidized by the United Kingdom government.\nAccording to the Complaint, the Complainant originally operated under the name the \u201cOccupational Pensions Advisory Service\u201d from around 1990. It changed its name to its present name in 2004.\nThe Complaint contains some limited evidence of use of the name \u201cThe Pensions Advisory Service\u201d prior to that date.\nNonetheless, with its adoption of the corporate name in 2004, it established a website to promote its services at \u201chttp://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk\u201d. The domain name <pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk> also resolves to that website.\nThe print-outs of the website and brochures included in, in particular, Annex 13 to the Complaint demonstrate clear use of the name \u201cThe Pensions Advisory Service\u201d in a trademark sense, i.e., as an identifier of the services that it offers to the public.\nDuring 2007-2008, the Complainant handled nearly 60,000 calls to its helpline, received more than half a million visitors to its website and helped more than 7,000 people with their pension disputes. The Complainant has spent more than \u00a360,000 in 2006 and \u00a380,000 in 2007 on promotional materials. Its projected expenditure in 2008 is \u00a3114,000.\nThe domain name was registered on": [

Complainant has since February 2000 sought United States federal trade mark protection by way of fourteen applications.\nSince 1814, both Reckitt & Coleman plc and Benckiser N.V. have used the RECKITT and BENCKISER names in commerce in connection with the manufacture and distribution of household cleaning and health and personal care products, so much so that Reckitt Benckiser is currently the world leader in five core categories: Fabric Care, Surface Care, Health and Personal Care, Dishwashing and Home. Therefore, following the merger, and even before they sought trade mark registration, the names, both individually and together have become sufficiently distinctive for Reckitt Benckiser AG to have acquired unregistered common law trade mark rights in the name RECKITT BENCKISER.\n4.3 Activities of the Respondent\nThe following is asserted as fact in the Response:\nThe Respondent is the registrant of the Disputed Domain Names. The Respondent asserts that on March 3, 1997, he signed a contract which was a freelance agreement for employment (the \"Contract\"). The Respondent asserts that the Contract was signed by Mr. Caner Tunaman as the general manager of Reckitt Benckiser, Turkey. The Respondent asserts that Mr. Tunaman signed the Contract as the CEO of Yenisoluk CSA, but that the Contract also covers the tasks and jobs for Benckiser.\nThe Respondent further asserts that after a few years he was promoted as technical manager and \"post production field\" for Benckiser Turkey by Mr. Tunaman and raised to an executive level in Benckiser.\nThe Respondent asserts that the years 1999-2000 were the last years in his job at Benckiser.\nThe Respondent has not provided any further information with regard to his present activities.\n  5. The Complainant\u2019s contentions in the Complaint\n5.1 The Complainant asserts that each of the elements specified in paragraph 4(a) of the Policy have been satisfied.\nIn reference to the element in paragraph 4(a)(i) of the Policy, the Complainant alleges that the Disputed Domain Names are identical and/or confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trade mark registrations.\nThe Complainant asserts that the Disputed Domain Names are identical and/or confusingly similar as follows:\n<reckittbenckiser.net>\n<reckittbenckiser.org>.\nThe relevant part of the above domain names is \"reckittbenckiser\". The Complainant asserts that this is textually identical to its RECKITT BENCKISER mark.\n<reckitt-benckiser.net>\n< reckitt-benckiser.org>\nThe relevant part of the above domain names is \"reckitt-benckiser\". The Complainant asserts that this is so textually similar as to be almost identical to its RECKITT BENCKISER marks. The Complainant asserts that the inclusion of the hyphen leaves intact the phonetic and visual similarities between the domain names and the Complainant\u2019s trade mark.\n<reckitt.net>\nThe relevant part of the above domain name is \"reckitt\". The Complainant asserts that this is textually identical to half of its RECKITT BENCKISER marks. The Complainant is the proprietor of a US registered trade mark as well as having common law rights in the RECKITT name.\n<benckiser.net>\n<benckiser.org>\nThe relevant part of the above domain names is \"benckiser\". The Complainant asserts that this is textually identical to half of its RECKITT BENCKISER marks and as such is confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s mark, given the origin of the RECKITT BENCKISER name, so that the public is likely to be misled as to the origin of any goods or services bearing the above domain names. In addition, the Complainant has common law rights in the BENCKISER name.\n<reckittprofesional.net>\n<reckittprofessional.org>\nThe relevant part of the above domain names is \"reckittprofessional\". The Complainant asserts that this is textually similar to its RECKITT BENCKISER marks. The Complainant also asserts that it already uses the term \"professional\" in relation to its products geared at the professional field, such as cleaning professionals or health care professionals. The Complainant further asserts that these names are merely derivative of the Complainant\u2019s marks and are confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s marks as to origin. Consequently, the Complainant asserts that the public is very likely to be confused as to an association between the Complainant and the Respondent or to infer an endorsement by the Complainant of any activities the Respondent embarks on using the domain names.\nThe Complainant also asserts that in November 2001, it became aware that the domain name <reckittbenckiser.org> was registered to the Respondent. Upon further investigation, the Complainant discovered that the Respondent has registered each of the Disputed Domain Names. The Complainant approached the Respondent by telephone on November 14, 2001, asking his interest in the Disputed Domain Names. Respondent claimed that he was a former employee of an advertising agency used by Reckitt Benckiser Turkey. He also claimed that he had registered the names on request of the President of Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s Turkish concern in order to safeguard the names from cybersquatters and name grabbers. Respondent, who now resides in the United States, further stated that he had attempted to approach Complainant to transfer the names at least two years ago but had received no Response from any of the people he had approached at Complainant\u2019s headquarters in the United Kingdom.\nThe Complainant further asserts that it requested that Respondent forward the said letters again. By email cover letter of November 14, 2001, Respondent forwarded the said letters to the Complainant. On receipt of the letters, it became clear, according to Complainant, that Respondent had written them during the previous month in September 2001 and not two years prior as he had claimed. Respondent also, in his cover letter, confirmed that he had placed all names for sale on <afternic.com> auction site and forwarded his user name to Complainant so Complainant could access the proper page of the auction site showing the names in question on offer. In the said cover letter, Respondent further stated, \"If Reckitt Benckiser or their associates are ready to afford my expenses, domain name and transfer fees I\u2019ll gladly transfer them.\"\nThe Complainant asserts that, by email of November 14, 2001, it requested of the Respondent what and how much his reasonable expenses were so that that amount would be made available to him in return for the transfer of the names. Respondent responded on the same date stating that he would expect his reasonable expenses to be covered not merely his registration costs. On November 16, 2001, the Complainant responded to the email, answering to the issues raised by the Respondent and explaining that they were only genuinely interested in facilitating a transfer for an amount that would fairly cover the expenses incurred by the Respondent in connection with the names.\nThe Complainant asserts that the Respondent did not respond to the email of November 16, 2001, and was contacted again by telephone early in December. The Complainant asserts that on December 7, 2001, the Respondent sent an email to the Complainant in which he completely changed his story and alleged that he has pending litigation with the Complainant. The Complainant states that neither the Complainant, its UK headquarters nor its Turkish sister company have ever been involved in any litigation with the Respondent as claimed in the Respondent\u2019s letter. Secondly, the Complainant asserts that the Respondent has never been an employee of the Complainant or any of its associated companies, both in Turkey and elsewhere. Therefore, the Complainant could not owe him any salary or expenses as claimed. Finally, the Complainant asserts that by the Respondent\u2019s own admission the Respondent has registered names, with no legitimate interest as he earlier tried to claim but rather, with the intention of selling them to the Complainant.\n5.2 In reference to the element in paragraph 4(a)(i) of the Policy, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interest in the Disputed Domain Names. The Complainant asserts that the Respondent has not used the domain names for a bona fide offering of goods or services and there is no evidence that he intends to do so nor does he appear to be making or have made a legitimate non-commercial or fair use of the domain name.\nThe Complainant further asserts that the Respondent, both as an individual and as a business, has never been commonly known as RECKITT BENCKISER or RECKITT, or BENCKISER. The Complainant asserts that except for the registration of the Disputed Domain Names, which are listed for sale on the <afternic.com> auction site, the Respondent and any business of the Respondent have never used the RECKITT BENCKISER or RECKITT or BENCKISER names. The Complainant asserts that such use of the Disputed Domain Names is bad faith and should not be taken to give the Respondent rights in the RECKITT BENCKISER or RECKITT or BENCKISER names.\nThe Complainant drew the Panel\u2019s attention to National Football League Properties, Inc and Chargers Football Company v One Sex Entertainment Co., a/k/a chargergirls.net, WIPO Case No. D2001-0118, where it was held that:\n\"Bad faith use of domain names does not establish rights or legitimate interests in respect of such names in the sense of paragraph 4(a)(ii) of the Policy.\"\nThe Complainant further contends that the Respondent has no trade mark rights whether registered or unregistered in the RECKITT BENCKISER or RECKITT or BENCKISER names and the Respondent is not a licensee or other authorised user of the Complainant\u2019s marks.\n5.3 In reference to the requirements of paragraph 4(a)(iii) of the Policy, the Complainant asserts that the Respondent registered and is using the Disputed Domain Names in bad faith. The Complainant asserts that under the Policy, bad faith registration and use can be found where the Respondent seeks to profit from the sale of the Disputed Domain Name in which it has no legitimate interest. In support of this assertion, the Complainant alleges, inter alia, that:\n(a) the Respondent by his own admission was fully aware of the Complainant\u2019s RECKITT BENCKISER marks and their reputation at the time of his registration of the names and could have had no good intention except to sell the names to the Complainant.\n(b) given the long use and well-known character of the Complainant\u2019s mark, the Complainant was the most likely purchaser (if not the only purchaser) of the Domain Names.\n(c) the Respondent cannot argue that he was unaware of the well-known character of the Complainant\u2019s marks since he had intimate knowledge of the mark as an employee of the Complainant\u2019s Turkish advertising agency. The Respondent\u2019s job would have involved the promotion and nurturing of that very character.\n(d) the Respondent registered the names with a view to profiting from their sale. Having registered them, his subsequent conduct in offering them for auction on the <afternic.com> site is evidence of bad faith use on his part.\n(e) when contacted by the Complainant, the Respondent offered to transfer the Disputed Domain Names for a price, and was reluctant to divulge what his reasonable out of pocket expenses were with regard to the Disputed Domain Names. The Complainant referred to a letter at Annexure H. The Complainant asserts that in this letter the Respondent makes clear his intention to sell the Disputed Domain Names for an amount that far exceeds the likely out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Respondent.\n  6. The Respondent\u2019s contentions in the Response\n6.1 The Panel notes that pursuant to paragraph 5(b)(viii) of the Policy a Respondent is required to conclude their Response with the following statement:\n\"Respondent certifies that the information contained in this Response is to the best of the Respondent\u2019s knowledge complete and accurate, that this Response is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, and that the assertions in this Response are warranted under these Rules and under applicable law, as it now exists or as it may be extended by a good faith and reasonable argument\"\nThe Panel notes that the Respondent has failed to comply with paragraph 5(b)(viii) of the Policy. It would be desirable for the Center to remind respondents to comply with this provision whenever the prescribed certification is not provided. A Panel is otherwise entitled to draw adverse inferences from a respondent\u2019s not having certified their response as accurate (see also Rule 14).\n6.2 In his Response, the Respondent has made a number of assertions. The Response does not clearly respond to the assertions put forward by the Complainant. From an examination of the Response and consideration of the emails dated May 3, 2002, (as referred to in para 3.10) and the translated documents entitled \"Employment Agreement\" and \"Turkish Republic Istanbul 7th Employment Law Court - Verdict\" the Panel was able to determine that the Respondent was asserting that he had no intention to gain any benefit from the registration of the Disputed Domain Names.\nFurthermore, the Respondent asserts that he purchased the Disputed Domain Names on the order of Mr. Caner Tunaman, the General Manager of Reckitt Benckiser. The Respondent asserts that on March 3, 1997, the Respondent signed a contract at Mr. Tunaman\u2019s executive office of Benckiser in Istanbul. The Respondent described the Contract as a freelance agreement for employment. The Respondent asserts that Mr. Tunaman signed the contract as the CEO of Yenisoluk CSA but that the Contract covers the tasks and jobs for Benckiser.\nOne of the translated document does indeed appear to be an employment agreement between Yenisoluk CSA and the Respondent.\nThe Respondent further asserts that in the following years he was promoted to technical manager for media and post-production field for Benckiser Turkey and raised to an executive level in Benckiser.\nThe Respondent further asserts, inter alia, that whilst employed by Yenisoluk CSA he started a project that allowed users to follow their production status from the company\u2019s website. After purchasing <yenisoluk.com.tr>, Yenisoluk \"embedded\" Benckiser Turkey into the website. The Respondent asserts that at that moment he \"found out\" that some of the Disputed Domain Names were not yet purchased. The Respondent asserts that he then informed Mr. Tunaman about this and was ordered by Mr. Tunaman to purchase all the Disputed Domain Names.\nThe Respondent claims that it was agreed in the Contract that \"like all other expenses we would deduct the domain name fees and I\u2019ll transfer the names in the next month\u2019s payment.\" The Panel infers this to mean that the Respondent was under the belief that if he purchased the Disputed Domain Names he would be reimbursed the registration costs by Yenisoluk CSA and once reimbursed he would transfer the Disputed Domain Names. It is not clear to the Panel who the Disputed Domain Names would be transferred to.\nThe Respondent further claims that soon thereafter he was fired by Yenisoluk CSA and was subsequently not paid for debts owed to him by Yenisoluk CSA. The Respondent indicated in his Response that he has instigated legal proceedings against Yenisoluk CSA for the recovery of debts owing, including the recovery of the expenses associated with the registration of the Disputed Domain Names.\nThe Respondent further claims that the Court found in favour of him. The Panel has reviewed the Court decision annexed to the Response and confirms that the Court Proceedings were between the Respondent and the Respondent\u2019s employer being Yenisoluk CSA and was a claim heard in the 7th Employment Law Court in Istanbul, Turkey.\nThe Respondent asserts that the decision of the Court has been appealed by Yenisoluk CSA and as a consequence the Respondent has chosen not to transfer the Disputed Domain Names.\nThe Respondent asserts that he has attempted discussions with the Complainant with regard to the potential transfer of the Disputed Domain Names, but these discussions have been unsuccessful.\n  7. Discussion and Findings\n7.1 To succeed the Complainant must prove each of the following elements:\n(i) that each domain name registered by the Respondent is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the Complainant has rights; and\n(ii) that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of each domain name; and\n(iii) that each domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\n7.2 Identical or Confusingly Similar Domain Name\nThe Disputed Domain Names are:\n<reckittbenckiser.net>\n<reckittbenckiser.org>\n<reckitt-benckiser.net>\n<reckitt-benckiser.org>": [

"Papua New Guinea, People\u2019s Republic of China, Russian Federation, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, The Philippines, Tonga, United Kingdom, United States of America, Vanuatu and Vietnam. In addition, the Complainant has obtained a registered European Community Trade Mark for a trademark including the word \"Telstra\".\nIncluded in the Complainant\u2019s Australian trademarks are 20 comprising and containing the word \"MobileNet\", including a pending application for \"Telstra MobileNet. Far and Away Australia\u2019s Best\". It first launched its MobileNet brand in Australia in 1987 for use in its mobile telecommunications service. It was also used in conjunction with the word \"Telstra\" from 1995. Telstra MobileNet was registered as a business name in 1995/6 in all Australian states and territories, save one.\nThe Complainant\u2019s products and services are offered by reference to the \"Telstra\" trademark alone, or in combination with other trademarks, such as \"MobileNet\" or \"Telstra Shop\". It provides more mobile phone services to more Australians than any other mobile phone service provider. It is a major sponsor of sporting, cultural and entertainment events. In the 1999/2000 financial year, it spent $A208.9 million on advertising and promotion.\nOn July 27, 2000, the Respondent advised that the website \"telstramobilenet.com\" was for sale. There was no \"cease and desist\" letter from the Complainant as is usually the case. However, for such a cheeky exercise as the Respondent\u2019s, one was hardly necessary.\n  5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nThe Complainant submits that its mark is a household name throughout Australia and is known in other countries in which it trades. It submits that the disputed domain names are identical with two of its marks \u2013 \"Telstra\" and \"MobileNet\" \u2013 as well as confusingly similar to its extensive portfolio of registered marks.\nThe Respondent\u2019s only use of the domain names has been to offer \"telstramobilenet.com\" for sale.\nThe Complainant alleges that the Respondent must have known of its marks at the date of registration, given the Complainant\u2019s profile in Australia. His attempt to sell one of the names indicates bad faith use, as does his continued passive holding of the names.\nThe": [

"le Canton de Montcuq, ou aucun journal gratuit d\u2019annonces n\u2019est distribu\u00e9.\nA c\u00f4t\u00e9 de ses activit\u00e9s d\u2019auteur-\u00e9diteur ind\u00e9pendant il se consacre \u00e0 la gestion de plus de 60 sites Internet;\nLe d\u00e9fendeur affirme que le requ\u00e9rant sait parfaitement que sa marque lui \u00e9tait inconnue. Il rappelle que la publication ParuVendu n\u2019est pas forc\u00e9ment distribu\u00e9e dans toute la France et notamment dans les petits villages ou hameaux \u00e9loign\u00e9s des villes (il vit \u00e0 35 kilom\u00e8tres de Cahors). Enfin quel que soit le montant des campagnes publicitaires, nul n\u2019est cens\u00e9 \u00e9couter RTL ou lire les journaux \u201dLe Monde\u201d et \u201dLa Tribune\u201d.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur indique aussi que c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019il est attaqu\u00e9 par une marque mais il se demande comment se fait-il que le requ\u00e9rant, ou son licenci\u00e9 la Comareg n\u2019aient pas song\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9server des noms de domaine tels que <paruvendu.info> ou <paruvendu.org> dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils craignaient tant la concurrence.\nIl insiste aussi sur le fait que le requ\u00e9rant fournit une fausse date du retrait de la lettre recommand\u00e9e (21 f\u00e9vrier 2005). C\u2019est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 le 8 mars que cette lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e et le requ\u00e9rant utilise le site \u201dwww.paruvendu.fr\u201d apr\u00e8s cette derni\u00e8re date pour laisser croire que le d\u00e9fendeur connaissait la marque PARUVENDU en 2003.\nDe tout cela il r\u00e9sulte que le dossier du requ\u00e9rant est \u201cd\u00e9loyal, tronqu\u00e9,inexact, malhonn\u00eate\u2026\u201d et que finalement aucune mauvaise foi n\u2019est prouv\u00e9e.\n  6. Discussion et conclusions\nLe paragraphe 15(a) de R\u00e8gles indique \u00e0 la Commission administrative les principes de base \u00e0 utiliser pour se d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une plainte : la Commission doit d\u00e9cider sur la base des expos\u00e9s et documents soumis selon les Principes directeurs et R\u00e8gles d\u2019application ainsi que toutes les r\u00e8gles ou principes l\u00e9gaux qui lui semblent applicables.\nAppliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce cas, le paragraphe 4(a) des Principes directeurs indique que le requ\u00e9rant doit prouver chacun des points suivants :\n(i) Le nom de domaine enregistr\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur est identique ou semblable au point de pr\u00eater \u00e0 confusion avec la marque invoqu\u00e9e par le requ\u00e9rant ; et\n(ii) Le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019a ni droit ni int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gitime sur le nom de domaine enregistr\u00e9 ; et\n(iii) Le nom de domaine a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 et utilis\u00e9 de mauvaise foi.\nA. Identit\u00e9 ou similitude pr\u00eatant \u00e0 confusion\nSur ce point il est clair qu\u2019il y a similitude au point de pr\u00eater \u00e0 confusion entre le nom de domaine litigieux <paruvendu.net> et les marques du requ\u00e9rant.\nLe nom de domaine et les trois marques invoqu\u00e9es par le requ\u00e9rant tirent leur distinctivit\u00e9 des deux mots paru et vendu et de leur rapprochement.\nLes \u00e9l\u00e9ments figuratifs ne sont manifestement pas de nature \u00e0 supprimer le risque de confusion puisque les noms de domaines sont exclusivement compos\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments verbaux.\nEn tant que de besoin nous rappellerons qu\u2019il est constant dans une telle proc\u00e9dure UDRP qu\u2019il n\u2019y pas lieu de prendre en consid\u00e9ration le gTLD de premier niveau (.net) dans l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation de la similitude.\nM\u00eame si cela est plus pertinent sous le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019UDRP (4(a)(iii) des Principes directeurs), rappelons que les observations du d\u00e9fendeur sur la liste des produits et services des marques oppos\u00e9es ne sont pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel d\u00e8s lors que subsiste la confusion possible dans l\u2019esprit du public. Au demeurant, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et de mani\u00e8re superf\u00e9tatoire, la liste des produits et services pour les trois marques oppos\u00e9es pr\u00e9voie les journaux, les annonces et les publications en ligne. Nous sommes donc dans le m\u00eame secteur d\u2019activit\u00e9.\nNous concluons donc que le nom de domaine est identique ou semblable au point de pr\u00eater confusion avec les marques du requ\u00e9rant.\nB. Droits ou l\u00e9gitimes int\u00e9r\u00eats\nLe d\u00e9fendeur lui-m\u00eame indique dans sa r\u00e9ponse qu\u2019il n\u2019a, sur l\u2019expression \u201cparuvendu\u201d aucun droit au titre des marques, de l\u2019enseigne ou du nom commercial.\nDe m\u00eame il r\u00e9sulte du dossier que le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019exer\u00e7ait aucune activit\u00e9 sous ce nom avant l\u2019enregistrement du nom de domaine.\nL\u2019argument du d\u00e9fendeur selon lequel il aurait compos\u00e9 une chanson \u201cParuvendu.net\u201d,\u00e0 une date d\u2019ailleurs non pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e, n\u2019est pas pertinent dans le contexte de cette proc\u00e9dure. Ceci ne lui conf\u00e8re donc aucun droit ou int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e9gitime.\nC. Enregistrement et usage de mauvaise foi\nLe requ\u00e9rant a expos\u00e9 la tr\u00e8s large diffusion de sa publication gratuite \u201cParuVendu\u201d (17 millions d\u2019exemplaires par semaine), le rachat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Comareg et la fusion des deux r\u00e9seaux, le changement de nom du journal Bonjour en ParuVendu et l\u2019annonce de ce changement (notamment dans l\u2019\u00e9dition de Cahors \u201cbonjour le 46\u201d) avant l\u2019enregistrement du nom de domaine litigieux par le d\u00e9fendeur, et enfin une vaste campagne publicitaire.\nEn d\u00e9pit de ces circonstances le d\u00e9fendeur soutient qu\u2019au moment de l\u2019enregistrement il ne connaissait pas l\u2019existence du journal ParuVendu et ne connaissait pas non plus l\u2019existence des marques du requ\u00e9rant. Il affirme avec force que l\u2019id\u00e9e du site <www.paruvendu.net> lui est venue spontan\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019esprit.\nPlusieurs consid\u00e9rations doivent \u00eatre prise en compte pour appr\u00e9cier la situation:\nDans sa r\u00e9ponse le d\u00e9fendeur expose qu\u2019\u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de ses activit\u00e9s d\u2019auteur \u00e9diteur il s\u2019est consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de sites Internet (66 sites d\u00e9di\u00e9s \u00e0 la chanson, \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature et aux annonces gratuites). D\u00e8s l\u2019an 2001, il a cr\u00e9\u00e9 plusieurs sites d\u2019annonces gratuites dont il donne des exemples. C\u2019est dans le cadre de cette d\u00e9marche qu\u2019il dit avoir cr\u00e9\u00e9 le site litigieux \u00e0 la fin de 2003.\nAu moment de l\u2019enregistrement du site en question il indique avoir redout\u00e9 que ce site ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9 avant lui comme cela lui \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 arriv\u00e9.\nEn d\u2019autres termes le d\u00e9fendeur n\u2019est pas uniquement un auteur mais un praticien des sites Internet, notamment dans le domaine des annonces, et semble conna\u00eetre quelques r\u00e8gles \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires telle que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019enregistrer son site en premier. En revanche il indique que c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019il est attaqu\u00e9 sur la base de marques. La consultation du Whois montre que le contrat de r\u00e9servation d\u2019un nom de domaine soumet ce dernier en cas de d\u00e9saccord sur la possession au syst\u00e8me uniforme de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends de l\u2019ICANN.\nEn tant que praticien, cr\u00e9ateur de nombreux sites Internet, le d\u00e9fendeur ne devrait pas ignorer que la possession d\u2019un nom de domaine s\u2019expose non seulement \u00e0 une r\u00e9servation ant\u00e9rieure mais aussi \u00e0 des marques ant\u00e9rieures et que certaines pr\u00e9cautions peuvent \u00eatre prises avant toute r\u00e9servation.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur est non seulement praticien des sites Internet mais l\u2019une de ses sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s est la publication d\u2019annonces gratuites. Dans ce cadre, et m\u00eame s\u2019il habite un petit village isol\u00e9, il est un peu surprenant qu\u2019il ignore \u00e0 ce point l\u2019environnement de ce m\u00e9tier. Non seulement le journal gratuit \u201cParuVendu\u201d fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une tr\u00e8s large distribution dans toute la France (17 millions d\u2019exemplaires par semaine) mais aussi b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u2019une relative notori\u00e9t\u00e9: 37% ou 23% selon les \u00e9tudes de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 spontan\u00e9e n\u2019est pas si n\u00e9gligeable que cela. De surcro\u00eet il suffit d\u2019interroger un moteur de recherche comme Google pour conna\u00eetre l\u2019existence du journal \u201cParuVendu\u201d.\nC\u2019est pourquoi, tout en reconnaissant qu\u2019il peut y avoir des co\u00efncidences fortuites, l\u2019argumentation du d\u00e9fendeur, m\u00eame si elle est s\u00e9duisante, n\u2019emporte pas notre intime conviction.\nPar ailleurs la lettre recommand\u00e9e du Cabinet Delsart Teston du 2 ao\u00fbt 2005": [

Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainants\nThe Complainants assert that the disputed domain name <knauffinsulation.com> is very similar to the trade name and company name Knauf Insulation. Indeed, the Complainants add that the signs differs only by one letter namely double \u201cf\u201d in the disputed domain name <knauffinsulation.com> instead of single \u201cf\u201d (in the trade name and company Knauf Insulation), so the Complainants argue that this is a case of typosquatting (using a small typographical variation between a famous trademark and the disputed domain name in order to attract unfairly Internet traffic).\nAdditionally, the Complainants allege that the domain name <knauffinsulation.com> is also confusingly similar to the trademarks owned by them. The Complainants assert that the trademark KNAUF INSULATION and the disputed domain name <knauffinsulation.com> are phonetically identical and that the addition of the letter \u201cf\u201d in the domain name is irrelevant. The Complainants also point out that the word trademarks (KNAUF INSULATION) are registered with a space between the sign \u201cknauf\u201d and \u201cinsulation\u201d while the dispute domain name <knauffinsulation.com> is registered without any space. The Complainants add that since it is not possible to include spaces in the domain name system, many UDRP decisions have concluded that the domain names are identical or confusingly similar to trade marks in similar circumstances.\nThe Complainants add that the domain name <knauffinsulation.com> is confusingly similar to the prior domain name owned by the second complainant: <knaufinsulation.com>, created on April 26, 2000.\nThe Complainants assert that the Respondent never used the disputed domain name. By typing the address \u201cwww.knauffinsulation.com\u201d, the results do not show any personal page of the Respondent but a webpage with \u201cpay-per-click\u201d links to third party websites, including links to direct competitors of the Complainants and other insulation and building products related sites.\nThe Complainants say that the disputed domain name was registered or acquired primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the owner of the trademark or service mark. The Complainant alleged that the disputed domain name should be considered as having been registered and used in bad faith by the Respondent because the latter is a known cybersquatter. Previous UDRP panels have found bad faith use and registration of domain names on the part of the Respondent in several other domain name dispute proceedings.\nB. Respondent": [

Party Night Inc., a/k/a Peter Carrington, Caso OMPI No. D2003-0796, se se\u00f1alaba:\n\u201cParagraph 4(a)(i) of the Policy requires, as one element to be proved, that the domain name be identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which Complainant has rights. These words do not require that Complainant be the owner of the mark and would include, for example, a licensee of the mark. It has been accepted in several decisions that a company related as subsidiary or parent to the registered holder of a mark may be considered to have rights in the mark. See for example Miele, Inc. v. Absolute Air Cleaners and Purifiers, WIPO Case No. D2000-0756 where Complainant's grand-parent corporation had a long established U.S. trademark registration for the mark for vacuum cleaners.\u201d\nPor lo dem\u00e1s, como se ha se\u00f1alado de la documentaci\u00f3n aportada se desprende que la Demandante es usuaria notoria de la marca ATIMPEX.\nEn consecuencia, este Experto considera que ha quedado acreditada la concurrencia del primero de los requisitos.\nB. Derechos o intereses leg\u00edtimos\nLa Demandada no ha contestado a la Demanda, por lo que no resulta posible conocer su versi\u00f3n sobre la posible existencia de derechos o intereses leg\u00edtimos sobre el nombre de dominio en disputa.\nNo obstante, examinado el expediente y todas las circunstancias y hechos que en \u00e9l constan, este Experto considera que:\n- La Demandante ha acreditado sus derechos sobre la denominaci\u00f3n ATIMPEX y su utilizaci\u00f3n en el mercado espa\u00f1ol, por lo que no parece razonable pensar que la Demandada, que tambi\u00e9n es una empresa del mismo sector comercial, sea igualmente titular de derechos o intereses leg\u00edtimos sobre la misma denominaci\u00f3n.\n- Accediendo a la p\u00e1gina web \u201cwww.atimpex.es\u201d se accede al sitio web del Demandado, en el que aparecen las marcas propias de \u00e9ste, pero no se hace referencia alguna a productos Atimpex, lo que parece confirmar que efectivamente el \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito del nombre de dominio en disputa es el de atraer a los internautas hacia los productos del Demandado. Al respecto hay que tener en cuenta que, tal y como alega la Demandante, \u201cAtimpex\u201d es una denominaci\u00f3n de fantas\u00eda y no responde a ning\u00fan significado gen\u00e9rico que pudiera cabalmente explicar su utilizaci\u00f3n.\n- La presentaci\u00f3n de un caso prima facie por parte del Demandante aunado a la ausencia de contestaci\u00f3n a la Demanda podr\u00eda indicar la inexistencia de derechos o intereses leg\u00edtimos por parte del Demandado. Este criterio ha sido seguido en innumerables decisiones, entre las que se encuentra Montes de Piedad y Cajas de Ahorro de Ronda, C\u00e1diz, M\u00e1laga, Almer\u00eda y Antequera (UNICAJA) v. Fernando Labadia Pardo, Caso OMPI No. D2000-1402, Hipercor, S.A. v. Miguel \u00c1. Gonz\u00e1lez, Caso OMPI No. D2000-0045 o Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. v. Juan Galan Luarca Asesores S.L., Caso OMPI No. D2008-0890 o Consejer\u00eda de Sanidad de la Comunidad de Madrid v. Juan Manuel Espejo-Saavedra Roca Caso OMPI No. DES2008-0031.\nPor todo ello, el Experto entiende que el Demandante ha cumplimentado tambi\u00e9n el segundo requisito exigido por el Reglamento, al no poderse acreditar en modo o manera alguna la existencia de ning\u00fan derecho o inter\u00e9s leg\u00edtimo a favor del Demandado en relaci\u00f3n con el nombre de dominio en disputa.\nC. Registro o uso del nombre de dominio de mala fe\nLa Demandante no ha aportado prueba alguna de las negociaciones que supuestamente mantuvieron las dos partes en 2006 y cuya ruptura, seg\u00fan afirma, condujo al registro del nombre de dominio en disputa por parte del Demandado.\nSin embargo, la Demandante s\u00ed ha acreditado claramente su presencia en el sector comercial com\u00fan a las partes bajo el distintivo ATIMPEX, e incluso el hecho de que el Demandado lo conoc\u00eda, pues en un momento determinado la Demandada nombr\u00f3 a Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00edn Romero": [

"Israele, Marocco, Messico, Federazione Russa, Turchia, gli Stati Uniti d'America.\nIl Ricorrente \u00e8 altres\u00ec titolare di oltre 100 nomi a dominio contenenti il marchio ENEL (Allegato 16 al Ricorso) tra cui <enel.it> risalente al 1996; la maggior parte di tali nomi a dominio reindirizza al principale sito web aziendale \u201cww.enel.com\u201d.\nIl Ricorrente \u00e8 stato official partner e/o sponsor di numerose manifestazioni sportive note a livello internazionale.\nIl nome a dominio contestato \u00e8 stato registrato il 5 gennaio 2021; alla data di presentazione del Ricorso esso indirizza ad una pagina web che viene peraltro segnalata dal sistema come pericolosa a causa di malware o phishing, come documentato nel Ricorso stesso.\n5. Argomentazioni delle parti\nA. Ricorrente\nIl ricorrente afferma e sostiene che:\n(a) il nome a dominio contestato \u00e8 confondibilmente simile al marchio ENEL di cui il Ricorrente \u00e8 titolare, in quanto lo incorpora nella sua interezza con l\u2019aggiunta del termine \u201citalos\u201d. Pertanto gli utenti di Internet e i consumatori focalizzeranno inevitabilmente la loro attenzione sul termine \u201cenel\u201d associandolo al ben noto e identico marchio del Ricorrente. Inoltre, nel linguaggio corrente italo/italos indica una origine italiana nella sua accezione italiana e inglese (ad es. ITALO-Britannico significa di origine Italiana e Inglese).\n(b) Il Convenuto non ha diritti o interessi legittimi sui nomi di dominio contestato poich\u00e9: (i) il Ricorrente non ha autorizzato o in alcun modo dato il consenso al Resistente a registrare e utilizzare il nome a dominio contestato; (ii) l\u2019uso da parte del Resistente del nome a dominio contestato non costituisce un\u2019offerta in buona fede di beni o servizi o un uso legittimo non commerciale e non vi \u00e8 evidenza che prima della notifica del presente procedimento al Resistente quest\u2019ultimo abbia posto in essere atti preparatori connessi ad un utilizzo in buona fede del nome a dominio contestato; (iii) il nome a dominio contestato punta semplicemente ad una pagina web inattiva che viene peraltro segnalata dal sistema come pericolosa a causa di malware o phishing.\n(c) Il nome a dominio contestato \u00e8 stato registrato in malafede. In quanto: (i) il marchio ENEL del Ricorrente \u00e8 noto in tutto il mondo e in Italia, dove ha sede il Resistente; (ii) \u201cenel\u201d non \u00e8 un termine comune o descrittivo ed il fatto che esso sia incorporato nel nome a dominio contestato indica che il Resistente mirava al marchio del Ricorrente al momento della registrazione del nome a dominio contestato.\nIl nome a dominio contestato \u00e8 inoltre utilizzato in malafede per una pagina priva di qualsiasi contenuto e sfrutta la reputazione del marchio ENEL del Ricorrente; ci\u00f2 integra una condotta di c.d. \u201cpassive holding\u201d in cui la giurisprudenza internazionale, nel caso a domini contenenti marchi anteriori noti, individua un chiaro indice di malafede.\nB. Resistente\nIl Resistente non ha presentato alcuna Risposta.\n6. Motivi della decisione\nIl paragrafo 15(a) delle Norme indica i principi che il Collegio deve applicare nel decidere la controversia e precisa che \u201cIl Collegio decide un ricorso sulla base delle dichiarazioni e dei documenti presentati dalle Parti in accordo con la Policy, le Norme ed ogni norma e principio di legge che ritiene applicabile\u201d.\nIl paragrafo 4(a) della Policy elenca i tre elementi che il ricorrente deve provare per ottenere una decisione che stabilisca che il nome a dominio registrato dal resistente debba essere cancellato o trasferito al ricorrente stesso:\n(i) il nome a dominio contestato \u00e8 identico o tale da indurre confusione rispetto ad un marchio su cui il ricorrente vanti diritti;\n(ii) il resistente non ha alcun diritto o interesse legittimo in relazione al nome a dominio contestato; ed\n(iii) il nome a dominio contestato \u00e8 stato registrato e viene usato in malafede.\nIl paragrafo 4(b) della Policy enuncia quattro circostanze esemplificative, che, ai fini del paragrafo 4(a)(iii) della Policy, costituiscono prova della registrazione e dell\u2019uso in malafede di un nome a dominio.\nIl paragrafo 4(c) della Policy stabilisce tre circostanze illustrative, ognuna delle quali, se provata dal resistente, costituisce prova dei diritti o degli interessi legittimi del resistente sul nome di dominio contestato ai fini del paragrafo 4(a)(ii) della Policy di cui sopra.\nA. Identit\u00e0 o somiglianza confusa tra il nome a dominio contestato ed il marchio del Ricorrente\nIl Collegio rileva che il Ricorrente ha provato di essere titolare del marchio ENEL sulla base delle registrazioni citate nella precedente sezione 4 e dei relativi certificati di marchio presentati come Allegato 15 al Ricorso.\nSecondo l\u2019orientamento prevalente dei Collegi OMPI (cfr. WIPO Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions, 3a edizione \u2013 di seguito \u201cWIPO Overview 3.0\u201d- sezione 1.8), laddove il marchio \u00e8 riconoscibile all'interno del nome a dominio contestato, l\u2019aggiunta del termine \u201citalos\u201dnon esclude la somiglianza confusa ai fini dell\u2019accertamento del requisito di cui al paragrafo 4(a)(i) della Policy.\nNello specifico, il nome a dominio contestato incorpora il marchio ENEL nella sua interezza e ad avviso del Collegio non pu\u00f2 sussistere alcun dubbio circa la sua somiglianza confusa con il marchio del Ricorrente. D\u2019altro canto l\u2019aggiunta del dominio di primo livello generico (\u201cgTLD\u201d) \u201c.org\u201d \u00e8 certamente irrilevante ai fini della valutazione della somiglianza confusa tra marchio e nome a dominio (cfr. WIPO Overview 3.0, sezione 1.11).\nIl Collegio ritiene quindi provata la prima condizione di cui al paragrafo 4(a)(i) della Policy.\nB. Assenza di diritti o d\u2019interessi legittimi del Resistente in relazione al nome a dominio contestato\nIl paragrafo 4(c) della Policy elenca, a titolo esemplificativo, le seguenti circostanze atte a dimostrare l\u2019esistenza in capo al resistente di un diritto o titolo sul nome a dominio, ovvero: (i) l\u2019uso o la preparazione all\u2019uso del nome a dominio per l\u2019offerta al pubblico in buona fede di beni e servizi; (ii) il fatto che il resistente sia comunemente conosciuto con il nome corrispondente al nome a dominio registrato; e (iii) un legittimo uso non commerciale del nome a dominio, oppure un uso commerciale dello stesso, senza per\u00f2 l\u2019intento di sviare la clientela del ricorrente o di violarne il marchio registrato.\nSecondo il costante orientamento dei Collegi OMPI, il ricorrente deve fornire la prova prima facie dell\u2019insussistenza, in capo al resistente, di un diritto o titolo in relazione al nome a dominio contestato; verificatosi ci\u00f2, \u00e8 onere del resistente fornire prova contraria (cfr. WIPO Overview 3.0, sezione 2.1).\nNello specifico, il Ricorrente dichiara di non aver autorizzato, concesso in licenza o permesso l\u2019uso del marchio ENEL al Resistente che d\u2019altra parte non pu\u00f2 dimostrare alcun legittimo uso non commerciale del nome a dominio contestato. Il Ricorrente ha inoltre fornito evidenza del fatto che il nome a dominio contestato indirizza ad una pagina ingannevole in vista.\nIl Collegio ritiene che il Ricorrente abbia assolto al proprio onere probatorio. Non presentando una Risposta formale, il Resistente non ha invocato alcuna circostanza che avrebbe potuto dimostrare un suo diritto o interesse legittimo sul nome a dominio contestato ai sensi del paragrafo 4(c) della Policy.\nIl Collegio ritiene dunque sussistente anche la condizione di cui al paragrafo 4(a)(ii) della Policy.\nC. Registrazione e Uso in Malafede\nAi sensi del paragrafo 4(a)(iii) della Policy, il Ricorrente deve dimostrare che il nome a dominio contestato \u00e8 stato registrato e viene utilizzato in malafede.\nIl nome a dominio contestato incorpora il marchio ENEL del Ricorrente. Data la distintivit\u00e0 e la consolidata notoriet\u00e0 del marchio del Ricorrente (riconosciute anche in Enel S.p.A. v. Lucky Graziano, enel.website,\nCaso OMPI n. D2021-1014) non \u00e8 concepibile che il Resistente non avesse in mente detto marchio al momento della registrazione del nome a dominio contestato e questo suggerisce che tale registrazione sia stata effettuata in malafede (cfr. WIPO Overview 3.0, sezione 3.2.2) con l\u2019intento deliberato di creare l\u2019impressione di un\u2019associazione con il Ricorrente.\nIl Collegio ritiene altres\u00ec che ricorra anche il secondo requisito di cui al paragrafo 4(iii)(a) della Policy, cio\u00e8 l\u2019uso in malafede. La circostanza che il nome a dominio contestato viene segnalato dal sistema come pericoloso a causa di malware o phishing conferma la malafede . Rientrano infatti nell\u2019ambito di applicazione del paragrafo 4(a)(iii) tutte quelle ipotesi in cui la registrazione del dominio \u00e8 avvenuta in malafede e le circostanze specifiche del caso inducano a ritenere che il resistente continuer\u00e0 ad agire in malafede. Nel caso di specie, alla luce delle considerazioni che precedono, il Collegio ritiene che non sia configurabile alcun uso legittimo del nome a dominio contestato da parte del Resistente e che il Resistente abbia registrato e utilizzato il nome a dominio contestato in malafede.\nIl Collegio ritiene dunque sussistente anche la condizione di cui al paragrafo 4(a)(iii) della Policy.\n7. Decisione\nPer i motivi sopra esposti e ai sensi dei paragrafi 4(i) della Policy e 15 delle Norme, il Collegio dispone il trasferimento a favore del Ricorrente del nome a dominio contestato <enelitalos.org>.\nAnna Carabelli": [

"Ronda, C\u00e1diz, M\u00e1laga, Almer\u00eda Y Antequera (Unicaja) v. Fernando Labadia Pardo, Caso OMPI No. D2000-1402.\nSobre el uso de mala fe, el Demandante sostiene que \u201cel Demandado mantiene el nombre de dominio <OMEGAFORT.COM> inactivo con la finalidad de, en un futuro, poder especular con su venta al leg\u00edtimo titular. Lo anterior conlleva un significativo perjuicio y viene a perturbar la actividad comercial de Megafort Pharma, S.L.\u201d, se\u00f1alando que \u201ces clara intenci\u00f3n de Ecommerce Pro Solutions Inc. impedir a esta parte acceder leg\u00edtimamente a su titularidad\u201d.\nEl Demandante se\u00f1ala que no es la primera vez que el Demandado lleva a cabo una actividad como la expuesta en la Demanda, ofreciendo como prueba el hecho de que el Demandado es titular de otros nombres de dominio que coinciden con marcas de terceros, como <novogear.com>, <conavit.com>, <azafranda.com>, <carbotrak.com> o <beautiseal.com>.\nAsimismo, la Demandante cita el caso Telstra Corporation Limited v. Nuclear Marshmallows, Caso OMPI No. D2000-0003, donde el experto declar\u00f3 que \u201cel asunto importante no estriba en el hecho de que el Demandado est\u00e9 realizando una conducta positiva de mala fe respecto del nombre de dominio, sino en el hecho de que, tomando en consideraci\u00f3n las circunstancias del caso, pueda concluirse que el Demandado est\u00e9 actuando de mala fe. La distinci\u00f3n entre llevar a cabo una conducta positiva de mala fe y actuar de mala fe parecer\u00e1 una distinci\u00f3n fina, pero es importante. Lo que dicha distinci\u00f3n significa es que el concepto de que un nombre de dominio \u2018se utilice de mala fe\u2019 no es limitativo respecto de una conducta positiva; en dicho concepto se incluye tambi\u00e9n la omisi\u00f3n [inacci\u00f3n, conducta pasiva]. En otras palabras, es posible que bajo ciertas circunstancias la omisi\u00f3n [o inactividad, pasividad] equivalga a la utilizaci\u00f3n de mala fe del nombre de dominio\u201d.1\nContinuando con el argumento de la tenencia pasiva como prueba de uso de mala fe, la Demandante se\u00f1ala los casos Real Madrid Club De Futbol v. Lander W.C.S, Caso OMPI No. D2000-1805, J. Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n, S.A. v. M\u00aa Jos\u00e9 Catal\u00e1n Fr\u00edas, Caso OMPI No. D2000-0239, Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba d/b/a Toshiba Corporation v. Distribution Purchasing & Logistics Corp., Caso OMPI No. D2000-0464 y Montes de Piedad y Cajas de Ahorro de Ronda, C\u00e1diz, M\u00e1laga, Almer\u00eda y Antequera (Unicaja) v.

Other trademark registrations belonging to the Complainant and shown in evidence cover Denmark, China, Japan, United Kingdom, India and the USA. It is absolutely wrong when the Respondent points to/refers to \u201crelevant jurisdiction of Ukraine\u201d with regard to the assessment of the Complainant\u2019s trademark rights. Ukraine is not the relevant jurisdiction for the assessment, nor is any other individual country. Reference is made to WIPO Jurisprudential Overview 3.0, point 1.1.2: \u201dNothing in particular the global nature of the Internet and Domain Name System, the jurisdiction(s) where the trade-mark is valid is not considered relevant to panel assessment under the first element\u201d. Be-sides, the domain name <0ne.com> is under a generic top-level domain and not a country code TLD, and it is registered with a US registrar. To conclude, the Complainant has undoubtedly established the first UDRP element.\nII. The Respondent does not have any rights or legitimate interest in the domain name\nUnder paragraph 4(a)(ii) of the UDRP, the Complainant has the burden of establishing that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain name. But by virtue of paragraph 4(c) of the Policy, it is open to a respondent to establish its rights or legitimate interests in a domain name. The applicable standard of proof is set out in WIPO Jurisprudential Overview 3.0, point 4.2, from which the following appears: \u201dThe applicable standard of proof in UDRP cases is the \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d or \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d; some panels have also ex-pressed this as an \u201con balance\u201d standard. Under this standard, a party should demonstrate to a panel\u2019s satisfaction that it is more likely than not that a claimed fact is true.\u201d This is the standard of proof that should be applied. Contrary to this, the Respondent\u2019s definition of the standard of proof in its Response. \u201dHowever, for Complainant to meet this part of the three-part test, the Panel must find that the Respondent has \u201da total lack of any right or legitimate interest\u201d; not merely that Complainant has purported \u201dbetter\u201d right or legitimate interest\u201d is completely out of line with established practice. The Complainant respectfully submits that the Complaint has made out a prima facie case that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the domain name. Therefore, the Respondent carries the burden of demonstrating rights or legitimate interests in the domain name. Reference is made to ADR.eu Case No. 101125 - AD6.MEDIA \u2013 where the Panel stated: \u201dIt is also well-established that a complainant is required to make out a prima facie case that the respondent lacks rights or legitimate interests and that when such a prima facie case is made, the respondent carries the burden of demonstrating rights or legitimate interests in the domain name. If the respondent cannot do so, a complainant is deemed to have satisfied paragraph 4(a)(ii) of the UDRP.\u201d Indeed, despite its comprehensive volume with many largely irrelevant annexes, the Response in this case has absolutely not succeeded in demonstrating rights or legitimate interests on the part of the Respondent, and therefore, the Complainant has satisfied paragraph 4(a)(ii). This is explained in further detail below. Under paragraph 4(c) of the Policy, it is open to the Respondent to establish its rights or legitimate interests in a domain name, among other circumstances, by showing, e.g., use of the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services; or that the Respondent is commonly known by the domain name, even without trademark rights; or legitimate non-commercial or fair use of the domain name. The Respondent has shown none of the above. The Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding rights or legitimate interests center around some fluffy assumptions, partly about zero (0) being the most commonly used number in crypto space, and partly about the Complainant\u2019s trademark being generic or commonly used. As to the Respondent\u2019s crypto-related activities, it is manifestly untrustworthy that the mentioned use of 0 in crypto wallets or the Respondent\u2019s username \u201dlendex0\u201d should pave the way for an assumption that the Respondent has rights or legitimate interests in any and all domain names starting with 0. The Response absolutely fails to explain why the domain name at issue should have any particular relevance. It must be assumed that the Respondent is fully aware of the weakness of this argument, as the Respondent also tries to argue that the Complainant\u2019s trademark is descriptive and commonly used. However, this argument also fails, as the Complainant\u2019s trademark One.com is absolutely not descriptive. On the contrary, it is a fanciful and inherently distinctive trademark, which ap-pears from the fact that the trademark has been registered as a word mark in many jurisdictions with no necessity to demonstrate prior fame, reputation or acquired secondary meaning anywhere. The trademark One.com has no dictionary meaning. It is strange to see that the Response includes more than ten references to the Complainant\u2019s trademark and the disputed domain name being generic, descriptive or commonly used. However, all the Respondent\u2019s statements to this effect are clearly wrong and will stay wrong, irrespective of how many times they are repeated. The Respondent\u2019s remarks about trademark classes and a search for \u201ddomain\u201d appear to be a misunderstanding of the trademark classification system and the guiding nature of the class numbers - apart from being irrelevant. To sum up, the Complainant has made out a prima facie case that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the domain name. The Respondent has not rebutted this in any way by demonstrating rights or legitimate interests in the domain name. Consequently, the Complainant has established the second UDRP element.\nIII. The domain name(s) has been registered and is being used in bad faith. The Complainant has demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that the disputed domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith. According to settled case law, it is not necessary for this finding that the domain name has been used in connection with an active website. Refence is made to ADR.eu Case No. 103037 - B0LL0RE.COM, where the Panel stat-ed: \u201dThe disputed domain name has not been used in connection with an active web site, i.e. has been passively held. As established in a number of prior cases, the concept of \u201cbad faith use\u201d in paragraph 4(b) of the Policy includes not only positive action but also passive holding, especially in cases of domain name registrations corresponding to distinctive and well-known trademarks; see i.a. the landmark case Telstra Corporation Limited v. Nuclear Marshmallows, WIPO Case No. D2000-0003\u201d Another, more striking aspect is that the Respondent claims that he was not aware of the Complainant\u2019s trademark and has deliberately chosen not to make any searches. Thus, ac-cording, \u201dRespondent further submits that as an experienced Inter-net user, he has neither check nor will ever check for short domain names like one.com\u2026.\u201d which is also supported by the Respondent\u2019s declaration to this effect. Of course, the Respondent cannot reasonably assume that short domain names are per se exempt from being in conflict with trademarks belonging to third parties. It is a fact that the Complainant\u2019s trademark is One.com. It is seven characters long including the dot, and so it is not particularly short. There is no reason to assume that the Complainant\u2019s trademark should be too short to be entitled to proper protection in the same way as any other trademark consisting of seven characters. The Respondent\u2019s reference in point C.6. to a trademark search for \u2018one\u2019 showing numerous results, does not contradict a proper trademark protection. Indeed, any search for the first three letters of a trademark may re-veal numerous results that may or may not be relevant. As an \u201dexperienced Internet user\u201d and \u201dreputed IT professional\u201d, there is no credibility to the Respondent\u2019s claim that he did not know of the Complainant\u2019s trade-mark. Even if this were true \u2013 which must be considered highly unlikely \u2013 it will still not bring the Respondent out of his bad faith. Thus, a deliberate choice not to make searches will amount to wilful blindness and render the Respondent responsible for the abusive domain name registration. Reference is made to WIPO Jurisprudential Overview 3.0, point 3.2.3, regarding wilful blind-ness: \u201cPanels have held that especially domainers undertaking bulk purchases or automated registrations have an affirmative obligation to avoid the registration of trademark-abusive domain names. Panelists will look to the facts of the case to determine whether such respondent has undertaken good faith efforts to screen such registrations against readily-available online databases to avoid the registration of trademark-abusive domain names.\u201d Especially in the case at hand, where the Respondent claims to be a professional and owns many domain names there is no excuse whatsoever for refusing to make searches for short domain names. The Respondent has explicitly admitted wilful blindness by stating that he has deliberately chosen not to make any prior search. Now the Response shows how easily the Respondent could find the Complainant\u2019s trademark as well as the Complainant\u2019s and domain name. So, the Respondent has shown that simple searches would reveal the relevant information. Against this backdrop, it is clear that the remarks in the Response: \u201cActual knowledge of the Complainant and its mark must exist for finding of bad faith\u201d and \u201dFor that bad faith to be present, the Respondent must have actual knowledge of the existence of Complainant, the trademark owner\u201d are simply wrong and contrary to practice. In addition to admitting wilful blindness, the Respondent has also admitted its intention to sell the domain name to customers with competing brands, cf. the Response where it is stated that the Respondent \u201dexpected the disputed domain to be of interest to potential customers having similar brand name, looking to establish an online presence.\u201d Registration of a domain name with an intention to sell it to the complainant or a competitor is one of the four circumstances set out in Paragraph 4(b) of the Policy, any one of which circumstances is evidence of the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith, although other circumstances may also be relied on, as the four circumstances are not exclusive.\nRegarding offers to sell, the following appears from WIPO Jurisprudential Overview 3.0, point 3.1.1: \u201dTaking the above scenarios into account, panels have generally found that where a registrant has an independent right to or legitimate interest in a domain name, an offer to sell that domain name would not be evidence of bad faith for purposes of the UDRP, irrespective of which party solicits the prospective sale. This also includes \u201cgeneralized\u201d offers to sell, including those on a third-party platform.\u201d However, in the case at hand, it has been demonstrated that the Respondent has no right or legitimate interest in the domain name, and therefore the offer to sell the domain name indicates bad faith. As a professional, the Respondent\u2019s intention to sell the domain name to interested customers as part of its business clearly suggests that such sale would be at a profit. This can also be seen from point B.8 of the Response, where the Respondent states \u201cRespondent registered the disputed domain recently as part of its similar investment strategy\u2026\u201d. This can only mean that the Respondent acquired the domain name as part of its business, and with intended profit. This is further substantiated by the email from the Respondent in reply to the Complainant\u2019s warning letter, inviting the Complainant to \u201dOffer price and buy it out\u201d and going on to say \u201dEither I make a deal\u2026\u201d. The Respondent\u2019s wording can only be understood to mean that he wanted to make a profit, which is further accentuated by the price tag of more than USD 33,000 for the domain name as shown in the evidence. The Respondent was fully aware of the fact that the domain name was for sale at an excessive price as this was mentioned in the warning letter. The Respondent\u2019s argumentation regarding the offering for sale, including that an offer could have been USD 100 or 1,000 is highly unconvincing. In addition, it appears explicitly from the above that the Respondent has never intended to use the disputed domain name in relation with an offer of goods and/or services. In the Response it is mentioned that \u201d[t]hough the registration date of the disputed domain is quite recent, it was previously registered since 1999\u201d. The Complainant would like to point out that the relevant date of registration of the domain name for the purpose of the case at hand is 13 July 2020 when the Respondent acquired the domain name. As set out in WIPO Jurisprudential Overview 3.0, point 3.9, \u201dthe transfer of a domain name registration from a third party to the respondent is not a renewal and the date on which the current registrant acquired the domain name is the date a panel will consider in assessing bad faith.\u201d It is a fact that the Complainant\u2019s trademark is \u201cOne.com\u201d, that is seven characters including the dot. To sum up, in view of the facts, and especially that the Respondent has explicitly admitted, 1) its wilful blindness, 2) its intention to sell the domain name to a customer with a similar brand at a profit, and 3) that it has no intention to use the domain name for a bona fide offer of goods and services, the third UDRP element has been established beyond any doubt. There is no reason whatsoever to consider Reverse Domain Name Hijacking. It is respectfully requested that the domain name should be transferred to the Complainant.\n\nRespondent\n\nOn or about 27 March": [

With a well-known, and in this case widely registered, trademark, Respondent was highly likely to have been fully aware of the trademark and of Complainant's rights in that trademark. Respondent would not otherwise have chosen to register a domain name based obviously on that mark. Respondent's intentional use of that mark in its entirety in registering the Domain Name is evidence of bad faith registration. See Lego Juris A/S v. Reiner Stotte, WIPO Case No. D2010-0494; Playboy Enterprises International, Inc. v. Pitts, WIPO Case No. D2006-0675; Ford Motor Co. v. Knuhtsen, WIPO Case No. DBIZ2002-00183.\nIt is true that the Domain Name resolves to an inactive webpage. However, such passive holding of the Domain Name may still constitute bad faith use depending upon the attendant circumstances. WIPO Overview 2.0, paragraph 3.2. See Lego Juris A/S v. Reiner Stotte, supra ; Telstra Corporation Limited v. Nuclear Marshmallows, WIPO Case No. D2000-0003. Here, the Panel considers the following factors to be indicative of bad faith use of the Domain Name:\n(i) Complainant's trademark was and is well-known in the field of hair care products based on long term use, promotion, Internet presence and sales around the world, including Japan;\n(ii) Complainant's trademark is internationally and nationally registered, including in Japan;\n(iii) Respondent did not reply to Complainant's cease-and-desist communications;\n(iv) Respondent did not respond to the Complaint in this proceeding to show actual use or demonstrable preparations for use of the Domain Name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services;\n(v) Respondent has apparently provided inaccurate contact information to the Registrar thus obstructing Complainant's ability to try to resolve the dispute short of this proceeding;\n(vi) \"Taking into account all of the above, it is not possible to conceive of any plausible actual or contemplated active use of the [Domain Name] by Respondent that would not be illegitimate, such as by being a passing off, an infringement of consumer protection legislation, or an infringement of Complainant's rights under trademark law.\" Telstra Corporation Limited v. Nuclear Marshmallows, supra.\nThe Panel considers the evidence of record sufficient to establish that Respondent both registered and is using the Domain Name in bad faith in this case.": [

Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\nThe Complainant argues that the disputed domain name <bradescoatual.com> is confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademark BRADESCO and the Respondent should be considered as having no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain name because it does not own any registration for the trademark or name BRADESCO;\nThe Complainant states that \u201cIf the domain name is of the free choice of the interested party, it must necessarily be found among expressions which are free for adoption, and not among trade names and registered trademarks belonging to third parties, and insofar as those distinctive signs constitute absolute rights, are opposable to undue use, as is determined by the rules of 8 \u201cICANN - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\u201d, which regulates the \u201c.com\u201d domain names\u201d\nIt is evident for the Complainant that the disputed domain name <bradescoatual.com> is confusingly similar to the BRADESCO trademark, to which it has prior and unencumbered rights.\nThe Complainant claims that the possibility of confusion is evident, saying that the disputed domain name <bradescoatual.com> is composed of the Complainant\u2019s trademark BRADESCO, and the term \u201catual\u201d, which is the Portuguese word for \u201ccurrent\u201d and argues that this leads to the conclusion that the disputed domain name <bradescoatual.com> is confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademarks.\nThe Complainant argues that the trademark BRADESCO is not a generic term, nor descriptive of the Complainant\u2019s products, and is not a dictionary word neither in Portuguese, English, French or Italian.\n\u201cBradesco\u201d is a coined word created by the joining of the first letters of the Complainant\u2019s previous commercial name (Banco BRAsileiro de DESCOntos) and as far as it is known, the Respondent\u2019s activities do not relate to the products commercialized under the BRADESCO trademark and the Respondent has never been known to be related or associated to said mark.\nFinally, the Complainant argues that the Respondent seems to have no interest in the disputed domain name, since it redirects Internet users to Google\u2019s main webpage, with no reference to the Respondent\u2019s activities or services.\nIf the webpage related to the disputed domain name has no reference to the Respondent\u2019s activities or services, the only plausible explanation for the Respondent\u2019s selection of the disputed domain name is to exploit in an unauthorized fashion the reputation and goodwill of the Complainant and its names and marks, and the bad faith of the Respondent can be deduced also by the fact that the Respondent has used the notorious mark BRADESCO as the major component of the disputed domain name, in circumstances in which the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the trademark.\nB.

The Complainant also owns a trademark registration for the COMPIERE mark in Hong Kong, SAR of China. A printout from a SAEGIS Trademark Report showing the Complainant\u2019s International Registration for the trademark COMPIERE, as well as a printout from the Hong Kong, SAR of China trademark database showing the COMPIERE registration has been provided to the Panel.\nThe Complainant registered the domain name <compiere.com> in 2000 and has used the domain name to operate a website continually since that time to promote and make available its Compiere software solutions. The Complainant also registered the domain name <compiere.org> in 2002. The trademark COMPIERE is prominently featured on the Complainant\u2019s website. Selected printouts from the Complainant\u2019s websites have been provided to the Panel.\nThe Complainant\u2019s initial trademark filing, its use of the COMPIERE marks, and its registration of the domain names <compiere.com> and < compiere.org> were all done before the Respondent registered the disputed domain name.\nIn addition, the COMPIERE mark is unique. A search of all available trademark databases on Thomson\u2019s Saegis database \u2013 a widely used commercial trademark database which covers the United States, Canada, virtually all European nations, including the United Kingdom and European Union Community Trademarks (CTM), International Registrations, Australia, Japan and Republic of Korea \u2013 shows only two other trademark applications that even use the term \u201ccompiere\u201d (both of which appear to be in reference to the Complainant\u2019s products, and which are objectionable as they were filed after the Complainant\u2019s applications and/or registrations). A printout from the SAEGIS Trademark database showing these two marks has also been provided to the Panel. Similarly, a search of the Hong Kong, SAR of China trademark database at \u201chttp://ipsearch.ipd.gov.hk/tmlr/jsp/main.jsp\u201d did not reveal any other companies that have applied to register the mark COMPIERE or any mark containing the term COMPIERE.\nThe COMPIERE mark has become widely-known in the open source community. Again, the Complainant\u2019s COMPIERE program has been downloaded over 1,000,000 times, and numerous articles have been written about the Complainant or make reference to the Complainant and its leading open source application, including in industry and trade publications (online and print) such as InfoWorld, CRM Today, ComputerWorld, The Age (Australia), and Business Week Online. In addition, the Complainant has issued numerous press releases that have been distributed by leading wire services such as Business Wire. In short, it is indisputable that the Complainant is the exclusive owner of the COMPIERE trademark.\nFurthermore, the Complainant has licensed selected technology companies to promote and provide support to the Compiere software. While the Compiere solution is open source software and is available to download for free, the Compiere software is backed by professional training, services, documentation, and a vibrant, responsive and knowledgeable worldwide open source community. Notably, the Complainant has a network of partners worldwide that provide implementation, support, training and related services to Compiere end users. The Complainant has these partners undergoing training to familiarize themselves with the Compiere solutions, and partners must also sign a Partner Agreement, which strictly controls partners\u2019 rights to use the mark COMPIERE and domain names. The Complainant has created and owns detailed training manuals, user documentation and related materials for the Compiere software. The Complainant\u2019s training materials are protected by copyright, and the Complainant and its founders own several copyright registrations in these materials. The Complainant sells its training materials through training seminars that the Complainant conducts for partners or others who pay the required training fees. The Complainant\u2019s user documentation is sold through the Complainant\u2019s web store.\nOn May 3, 2006, the Complainant\u2019s counsel sent a cease and desist letter to the Respondent in which counsel demanded that the Respondent cease use of the disputed domain name and transfer it to the Complainant.

"Lee County, Florida, and is providing space on its website for advertising by competitors of Complainant. Respondent is not making legitimate commercial, noncommercial or fair use of the Disputed Domain Names.\nPrior to any notice by Complainants to the Respondent of the dispute, there is no evidence of the Respondent\u2019s use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the Disputed Domain Names or a name corresponding to the Disputed Domain Names, in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services. The Respondent never has been commonly known by the Disputed Domain Names. The Respondent is not making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the Disputed Domain Names, without intent for commercial gain; the Respondent is using the Disputed Domain Names to misleadingly divert consumers to its websites.\n(iv) Complainant contends that Respondent registered and is using the Domain Names in bad faith in violation of Paragraph 4(a)(iii).\nThe Respondent registered and is using the Disputed Domain Names intentionally to attract, and attempt to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to its websites or other on-line locations, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the Complainants\u2019 BONITA BAY Marks as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the Disputed Domain Names and accompanying websites or other on-line location.\nComplainants allege that the Respondent\u2019s use and registration of the Disputed Domain Names prevents the Complainants, who are the owners of the legitimate trademark rights in the BONITA BAY Marks, from using such Disputed Domain Names in connection with the provision of the Complainants\u2019 Real Estate Goods and Services.\nIn addition, the Respondent registered the Disputed Domain Names in bad faith by doing so knowing of the Complainants\u2019 well-established and exclusive rights in and to the BONITA BAY Marks. The Respondent is located in southwest Florida and accepts advertising from real estate brokers in southwest Florida. As such, the Respondent is familiar with the real estate business in southwest Florida. The BONITA BAY Marks are well known, especially in southwest Florida, and it is inconceivable that the Respondent would not know of the Complainants or their BONITA BAY Marks.\nMoreover, basic domain name searches and other searches of the records of the USPTO and the Florida Department of State, all of which are readily accessible on-line, would have revealed to the Respondent that the Complainants owned domain names, federal trademark registrations, and Florida state trademark registrations for the BONITA BAY Marks. Even an Internet search would have revealed the Complainants\u2019 extensive use of the BONITA BAY Marks as a source identifier of the Complainants and their wide array of products and services. Such simple searches would have made the Complainants\u2019 exclusive rights in the BONITA BAY Marks obvious to the Respondent. Accordingly, the Respondent is deemed to have constructive notice of the Complainants\u2019 trademark rights by virtue of its federal and state trademark/service mark registrations in the BONITA BAY Marks.\nGiven the fame of the BONITA BAY Marks and the widespread recognition of the BONITA BAY Marks in the community in which the Respondent operates its business, there is no other conceivable interpretation of the Respondent\u2019s registration and use of the Disputed Domain Name other than that of bad faith. Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s use and registration of the Disputed Domain Names constitutes bad faith.\nAlthough by incorporating into its website information about the Bahamas and California the Respondent attempts to distance itself from the Complainants\u2019 BONITA BAY Marks and BONITA BAY Real Estate Goods and Services, the Respondent is using the Complainants BONITA BAY Marks in the Disputed Domain Names to point the Disputed Domain Names to its website to market competitive real estate services": [

"Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The Respondent registered the disputed domain name on April 8, 2008. Although the website associated with the disputed domain name now bears the legend \u201cunder construction\u201d and is otherwise blank, it originally hosted what appears to be a corporate website under the name GFI Finance which stated, on a page entitled \u201cAbout GFI Finance\u201d, that the Respondent was \u201cpart of the GFI Group which have business presence across Asia, Africa, America, Europe and Middle East [sic]\u201d. The Respondent\u2019s website also provided a downloadable form entitled \u201cGFI Finance Client Application Form\u201d requesting personal data from potential customers including passport scans, bank statements and investment portfolio valuations.\nOn May 20, 2010 the Complainant\u2019s legal counsel wrote to the Respondent by email asserting that the statement on the Respondent\u2019s website that the Respondent was part of the GFI Group was untrue, alleging trademark infringement and seeking written undertakings that the Respondent cease using the GFI mark and transfer the disputed domain name to the Complainant. On or about June 1, 2010 the Respondent replied via an unsigned and undated letter agreeing to cease operation of the disputed domain name but refusing to transfer it to the Complainant.\n5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\nThe Complainant contends that the disputed domain name is confusingly similar to trademarks in which it owns rights; that the Respondent has no right or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name; and that the disputed domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith.\nThe disputed domain name incorporates entirely the Complainant\u2019s distinctive trademark to which a descriptive word \u201cfinance\u201d has been added. This renders the disputed domain name confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademark. The added word is descriptive of services of the type offered by the Complainant and reinforces this confusion.\nThe Respondent has used the disputed domain name to ride on the goodwill and renown of the Complainant\u2019s trademark and cannot possibly have a right or legitimate interest thereby, particularly as it has fraudulently claimed that it was part of the Complainant\u2019s corporate group. That claim also demonstrates the fact that the Respondent was aware of the Complainant and intentionally sought to trade on its renown. The Complainant has not consented to the Respondent\u2019s use of the Complainant\u2019s trademark, the Respondent is not commonly known by the disputed domain name and there is no affiliation or connection between the Complainant and the Respondent. The Respondent is not using the disputed domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services and has agreed to cease using it such that it cannot use it for a bona fide offering in the future.\nThe Respondent is using the disputed domain name to perpetrate fraud against individuals who believe that the disputed domain name originates from or is connected with the Complainant and this is compelling evidence of registration and use in bad faith. Furthermore, the Respondent intended to divert customers from the Complainant for commercial gain, by creating confusion with the Complainant\u2019s trademark and this also evidences a bad faith registration and use of the disputed domain name.\nB.

"Changsha, \nand so on.  The sales of the \u201cOCHIR LY\u201d are among the bests and the brand \nfells swoop become the leader in women\u2019s fashion. \n (2) The mark \u201cochirly\u201d has been widely  used by the Complainant as trademark \nin mainland of China, and it is of great fame in China. \nThe Complainant and the \u201cOCHIRLY\u201d br and won the unanimous endorsement \nof the consumers with its high quality products and service and received many \nhonors from communities. At the same ti me, the Complainant always concerns \nabout public welfare and gets a good social  assessment. In or der to expand the \nreputation and influence of \u201cOCHIRLY\u201d brand, the Complainant has launched a \nlot of OCHIRLY brand advertising and gets a good result. The Complainant and \nthe OCHIRLY brand enjoy a good fame in  China with its high quality products \nand good publicity. \nThe Complainant is the owner of th e trademark \u201cOCHIRLY\u201d and has used \n\u201cOCHIRLY\u201d as trademark in business fi eld over 10 years. Owing to excellent \nmanagement and extensive promotion, products and services, the \u201cOCHIRLY\u201d \nbrand is in the front rank around the globe , especially in mainland of China.  \nMoreover, in 2007, the trademark \u201c\n \u201d (Registration No.: 3396321) \nowned by the Complainant was gran ted the well-known trademark in \nGuangzhou city, and in 2008, the tradem ark was also granted the famous \ntrademark in Guangdong province of China.\n5 \n (3) The Complainant has prior trademar k rights of \u201cOCHIRLY\u201d trademark; the \ndisputed domain name is confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademark. \nIt is well-known that \u201cOCHIRLY\u201d is a worldwide famous trademark which is \nowned by the Complainant. The validity and fame of its trademarks are beyond \ndispute. \nAs described in the above, the Complainant has lots of registered trademarks in \nmainland of China, all of them are in th e term of validity, including the earliest \none: \u201c\n \u201d (Registration No.: 1405051), which was registered in 2000.  \nThe registration date of all of them is much earlier than the registration date of \nthe disputed domain name, i.e. July 1,  2010.  Therefore, the Complainant has \nprior trademark rights of \u201cOCHIRLY\u201d. \nThe main part of the disputed domain name \u201ce-ochirly\u201d consists of \u201cochirly\u201d and \nletter \u201ce\u201d.  \u201cochirly\u201d is the well-known trademark of the Complainant.  The \nsingle letter \u201ce\u201d bears no specific meani ng.  Accordingly, the domain name \n\u201ce-ochirly.com\u201d is confusingly similar to the trademark \u201cOCHIRLY\u201d owned by \nthe Complainant and infringes upon the Complainant\u2019s legal rights. \nTherefore, the Complainant has proven paragraph 4(a)(i) of the policy. \n(4) The Respondent does not have any le gitimate rights or interests on the \ndisputed domain name. \nThe Respondent has no any legitimat e rights on the trademark.  The \nComplainant has searched through the on line trademark search systems of the \nChinese Trademark Office with the ke yword of the Respondent \u201cpri\u201d for all \ntypes of registration.  But no any trad emarks that the Respondent registered \nwere found.  \nThe Complainant owns the trademark exclusively and never authorized, \npermitted the Respondent to register or use the disputed domain name, or to use \nthe trade name or trademark for any purposes. The Complainant has never \nacquiesced the Respondent to register or use the disputed domain name in any \nway. \nFor these reasons, th e Complainant considers that, under the policy 4(a) (ii), the \nRespondent has no rights or legitimate interests for the disputed domain name. \n (5) The disputed domain name has been  registered and used in bad faith.\n6 \nThe trademark has been used in the global by the Complainant. And the \ntrademark enjoys a great reputation in the location that the disputed domain \nname was registered, so it is unimaginab le that the Respondent didn\u2019t know the \ntrademark when he registered the disput ed domain name.  For the trademark is \na fancy word, it is impossible for the Res pondent to think out the same word for \na domain name registration. Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s actions described that \nthe Respondent registered and used the disputed domain name in bad faith. \nThe Respondent established the website www.e-ochirly.com and named it as \n\u201cochirly official website\u201d with the di sputed domain name.  This domain name \nis linked to a website selling counterfeiti ng ochirly brand clothes, which have \ninfringed the business fame and trade ma rk right of the Complainant. The \ntrademark \u201cOCHIRLY\u201d owned by the Complainant enjoys a high reputation in \nChina, thus the Respondent knew clearly the existence of this famous trademark \nand still intended to confuse the consumers so as to gain improper interests.  \nThe Respondent using the disputed doma in name in this way will lead the \ninternet users to think by mistake that the website is operated by the \nComplainant, and will incr ease more clicks and awar eness of the Respondent\u2019s \nwebsite, and that the Res pondent may gain improper in terests on this ground.  \nTherefore, the conduct of the Respond ent falls under the circumstances in \nParagraph 4(b)(iv), i.e. \u201cby using th e domain name, you have intentionally \nattempted to attract, for commercial gain, internet users to your web site or other \non-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the Complainant's \nmark as to the source, sponsorship, affili ation, or endorsement of your web site \nor location or of a product or service on your web site or location\u201d.  \nFor the above reasons, the Complainan t considers that according to policy \nsection 4(a)(iii), the Respondent has registered and used the disputed domain \nname in bad faith. \nThe Complainant requests the Panel issu e a decision that the Disputed Domain \nName shall be transferred to the Co mplainant i.e. Tr endy international \ninvestment limited(\u8d6b\u57fa\u56fd\u9645\u6295\u8d44\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8) . \nThe Respondent \n \nThe Respondent": [

"\u6bb7\u78ca (Lei Yin), \u6768\u667a\u5f3a (Zhi Qiang Yang), WIPO Case No. D2021-0576).  \n \nOn the basis of the foregoing elements, the Panel finds that the Complainant has satisfied the requirements \nfor the second element under the Policy. \n \nC. Registered and Used in Bad Faith  \n \nThe Panel finds that the registration of the disputed domain name, which incorporates the Complainant\u2019s \nfamous trademark for SODEXO in its entirety, was selected and registered with the clear intention to divert \nInternet users to the Respondent\u2019s website linked to the disputed domain name.  The Panel has taken into \naccount the strong reputation and fame of the Complainant\u2019s trademarks (including in the Respondent\u2019s \njurisdiction China) and the Respondent\u2019s intentional misspelling of the word \u201cbenifits\u201d in the disputed domain \nname, which is particularly one of the main sectors in which the Complainant operates and which the Panel \nconsequently considers an attempt by the Respondent to create an unfair advantage from unsuspecting\npage 5 \n \nInternet users misspelling this word (\u201ctyposquatting\u201d).  Given these elements, the Panel considers that the \nregistration of the disputed domain name was conducted with obvious knowledge of the Complainant\u2019s prior \nregistered trademarks and was therefore obtained in bad faith.  \n \nAs to use of the disputed domain name in bad faith, the website linked to the disputed domain name \ncurrently displays what are presumed to be pay-per-click hyperlinks to the commercial services of unrelated \nthird parties.  This shows that the Respondent intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet \nusers to its website by creating a likelihood of confusion with the Complainant\u2019s trademarks as to the source, \nsponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the Respondent\u2019s website.  The Panel considers that this \nconstitutes direct evidence of bad faith of the Respondent under section 4(b)(iv) of the Policy.  The preceding \nelements lead the Panel to conclude that the Respondent is using the disputed domain name in bad faith.   \n \nFinally, the Respondent has failed to provide any response or evidence to establish its good faith or absence \nof bad faith.  The Panel therefore finds that the Complainant has satisfied the requirements of the third \nelement under the Policy.  \n \n \n7. Decision \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, in accordance with paragraphs 4(i) of the Policy and 15 of the Rules, the Panel \norders that the disputed domain name <sodexobenifits.com> be transferred to the Complainant. \n \n \n/Deanna Wong Wai Man/ \n": [

Consequently, the Complainant is the sole holder of the exclusive right to use \u201cOKNOPLAST\u201d word trademark in trading. By purchasing the right to \u201cOKNOPLAST\u201d word trademark, the Complainant took over the rights of the entity selling the trademark and therefore the protection resulting from the right to register \u201cOKNOPLAST\u201d word trademark has been in force since 25 March 1994.\nTherefore, the Complainant claims that it is at present and was on the date of filing the application for registration of www.oknoplast.eu domain, fully eligible to use this trademark; moreover, it is currently and was on the date of filing the above-mentioned application, the sole holder of the exclusive right to use \u201cOKNOPLAST\u201d word trademark.\nRegarding the domain names www.oknoplastkrakow.eu and www.oknoplast-krakow.eu\nOn 12 August 2004": [

"San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sudan, Switzerland, Ukraine, Viet Nam, Montenegro, Italia and Serbia; and\n- United States of America trademark number 74345754, for AMBIEN, applied on January 5, 1993 and registered on December 7, 1993 in class 5.\nComplainant is also the owner of the following domain names:\n- <ambien.com> registered on April 12, 2000;\n- <ambien.eu> registered on July 2, 2006;\n- <ambien.fr> registered on May 30, 2002;\n- <ambien.us> registered on April 19, 2002;\n- <ambien.net> registered on April 12, 2000;\n- <ambien.info> registered on August 24, 2001;\n- <ambien.org> registered on April 12, 2000;\n- <ambien.mobi> registered on August 2, 2006; and\n- <ambien.us> registered on April 19, 2002.\nComplainant notes that the above-mentioned trademarks and domain names were registered prior to November 10, 2017, the registration date of the disputed domain name. The disputed domain name redirects to a website at \u201cwww.toprxonlinemeds24.com\u201d that offers for sale the products under the Complainant\u2019s trademark AMBIEN.\n5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\nComplainant contends that the disputed domain name is confusingly similar to Complainant\u2019s registered trademarks and domain names. The product Complainant sells under the AMBIEN mark is a well-established sleeping aid. The term \u201cZolpidem\u201d is the generic production name for Ambien. Therefore, the addition of the term \u201cZolpidem,\u201d placed before AMBIEN in the disputed domain name, and the generic Top-Level Domain (\u201cgTLD\u201d) extension \u201c.club,\u201d are insufficient to alleviate the likelihood of confusion between Complainant\u2019s trademarks and domain names and the disputed domain name; indeed, Complainant contends that the addition of the generic term only increases the risk of confusion.\nComplainant contends that Respondent does not have any legitimate interest regarding the disputed domain name. Complainant has never licensed or otherwise authorized Respondent to use its marks. Complainant contends that \u201cWhoisGuard Protected\u201d or \u201cWhoisGuard, Inc.,\u201d the registrant of the disputed domain name as indicated on the Whois Database, is not the real registrant. WhoisGuard, Inc. is a service provided by the Registrar which allows its clients to register domain names in its name and on behalf of third parties in order to keep the true identity of the registrant secret. Therefore, Respondent does not have any legitimate interest in using the disputed domain name since the name \u201cWhoisGuard, Inc.\u201d does not bear any resemblance to the word \u201cambien.\u201d Further, Respondent is not using the disputed domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services, so as to confer a right or legitimate interest in it in accordance with paragraph 4(c)(i) of the Policy. Complainant contends that the disputed domain name leads to a competing website which offers for sale pharmaceutical products and delivers inaccurate information on Complainant\u2019s products. Complainant further contends that the disputed domain name was registered for the purpose of misleadingly diverting consumers into thinking that Respondent is, in some way or another, connected to, sponsored by or affiliated with Complainant or that Respondent\u2019s activities are approved or endorsed by Complainant.\nLastly, Complainant contends that Respondent was clearly aware of Complainant\u2019s distinctive and well-known AMBIEN mark when registering the disputed domain name. The disputed domain name leads to a website offering Ambien products for sale. By clicking on the \u201cAMBIEN\u201d products listed in \u201cBestsellers\u201d section, the Internet user is redirected to a page through which it can buy Ambien products. Respondent has intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to a competing website, by creating a likelihood of confusion with Complainant\u2019s mark and company name as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of Respondent\u2019s website or other location, constituting evidence of bad faith.\nB.

The domain name information provided by the Complainant shows that <ouicare.com> was \nregistered in the name of \u201cO2 d\u00e9veloppement\u201d instead of the Complainant, while the identity of the registrant \nof the other OUI CARE Domain Name <ouicare.fr> was masked by a privacy shield.  No further evidence \nhas been adduced by the Complainant concerning its relationship with \u201cO2 d\u00e9veloppement\u201d or its rights to \nuse the OUI CARE Domain Names.  Nevertheless, as the OUI CARE Domain Names resolve to the \nComplainant\u2019s Website, the Panel is satisfied that the OUI CARE Domain Names are registered by the \nComplainant\u2019s Group and/or the Complainant has equitable rights to use such domain names.  Indeed, a \nquick Internet search by the Panel shows that \u201cO2\u201d is a brand under the Complainant\u2019s Group.  \n \nThe Disputed Domain Name was registered on January 2, 2023": [

"Uganda, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Zambia, etc. In most of the countries the said trademark is registered in Class 28. However, in certain countries it is also registered in other Classes, including 3, 9, 14, 16, 20, 24, 25, 38, 41 and 42. A detailed list of the countries where the trademark LEGO is registered and the Classes in which it is registered is provided by the Complaint.\nThe Complainant has contended that the disputed domain name <movielego.com> includes its trademark LEGO. Anyone who sees the disputed domain name may believe that it is the domain name of the Complainant or that it is associated with it or has some kind of commercial relationship with the Complainant. Therefore, the likelihood of confusion cannot be ruled out. Thus, the disputed domain name is identical or confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademark LEGO.\nThe Complainant further contends that it is the owner of more than 2,400 domain names containing the word \u201clego\u201d and it is the strict policy of the Complainant that all domain names containing the word \u201clego\u201d should be owned by the Complainant.\nIn relation to element (ii), that is, that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain name, the Complainant contends that the Respondent has never registered the LEGO trademark or any similar trademark. The Respondent (as an individual, business, or other organization) has not been commonly known by the domain name <movielego.com>. The Respondent is known by the name of Mr. Aarsl Khan.\nThe Complainant has not given any license or authorization to use the trademark LEGO to the Respondent. The Respondent is not an authorized dealer of the Complainant\u2019s products and has never had a business relationship with the Complainant. Further, the Respondent is neither making a legitimate or fair use of the disputed domain name, nor is it using the disputed domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services. It is contended that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name.\nThus, the Respondent registered the disputed domain name for the sole purpose of creating confusion and misleading the general public and the customers of the Complainant.\nRegarding the element (iii), that is, that the disputed domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith, the Complainant contends that the Respondent\u2019s object in registering <movielego.com> was to earn profit by misleading the general public and the customers of the Complainant. The Respondent is not an authorized reseller of the Complainant\u2019s goods. The Respondent\u2019s use of the disputed domain name cannot be considered to be bona fide offering of goods and services.\nOn August 15, 2013 the Complainant alleges it sent a cease and desist letter to the Respondent. A reminder was also sent on October 7, 2013. However, the Respondent has failed to respond.\nB. Respondent\nThe Respondent": [

"Zaragoza, ciudad donde la marca CAJA DE AHORROS DE LA INMACULADA ha adquirido una significativa notoriedad. Asimismo, tal y como se ha indicado en los Antecedentes de Hecho de la presente decisi\u00f3n, parece imposible que el Demandado se sirva de cualquier forma de la denominaci\u00f3n \u201cCaja de Ahorros de la Inmaculada\u201d sin lesionar los derechos de la Demandante.\n- El Demandado trabaj\u00f3 durante un a\u00f1o como empleado de la Demandante, de modo que es inconcebible que, en el momento del registro del Nombre de Dominio, no fuera claramente consciente de que dicho registro (y su posterior uso) constitu\u00eda una clara infracci\u00f3n de los derechos de la Demandante.\n- Por \u00faltimo, de acuerdo con lo se\u00f1alado con anterioridad, el Demandado no ha aportado argumento alguno que permitiera justificar el registro del Nombre de Dominio.\nTeniendo en cuenta todo lo dicho, en opini\u00f3n de este Experto, la posibilidad m\u00e1s razonable para explicar el registro del Nombre de Dominio por parte del Demandado es que dicho registro respondi\u00f3 a criterios de mala fe, la cual ha quedado suficientemente acreditada por la Demandante.\n(ii) Utilizaci\u00f3n de mala fe del Nombre de Dominio por parte del Demandado.\nDe acuerdo con lo indicado en los \u201cAntecedentes de Hecho\u201d de la presente decisi\u00f3n, el Nombre de Dominio se encuentra desactivado, sin enlazar con p\u00e1gina web alguna. En este sentido, la tenencia pasiva como supuesto de mala fe en el sentido de la Pol\u00edtica ha sido reconocido en numerosas decisiones anteriores a la presente (ver, por ejemplo, Telstra Corporation Limited v. Nuclear Marshmallows, Caso OMPI N\u00b0 D2000-0003; CBS Broadcasting, Inc. vs. Edward Enterprises, Caso OMPI N\u00b0 D2000-0242,o Brown Thomas & Company Limited v. Domain Reservations, Caso OMPI N\u00b0 D2001-0592), si bien para reconocer dicha mala fe, la tenencia pasiva del Nombre de Dominio debe complementarse con una serie de indicios que permitan considerar que existe mala fe en el uso del Nombre de Dominio.\nEn el presente caso, teniendo en cuenta todas las circunstancias descritas en relaci\u00f3n con el Demandado y el Nombre de Dominio, parece claro que el uso del Nombre de Dominio responde a criterios de mala fe.\nEn efecto, el Nombre de Dominio corresponde a una marca notoriamente conocida en la provincia donde el Demandado reside, de modo que es dif\u00edcil imaginar cualquier uso que no produjera una lesi\u00f3n de los derechos de la Demandante, siendo dicha lesi\u00f3n perfectamente conocida por el Demandado. En este sentido, cabe recordar una vez m\u00e1s que este fue empleado de la Demandante, lo cual no hace sino reforzar la impresi\u00f3n anteriormente descrita. Dicha interpretaci\u00f3n ha sido adoptada en numerosas decisiones anteriores centradas en casos cuyas circunstancias eran equiparables a las que se dan en el presente procedimiento (ver, por ejemplo, la decisi\u00f3n en el Savino del Bene, Inc. v. Graciano Innocenti Gennari, Caso OMPI N\u00b0 D2000-1133, o en First National Telecom Services Limited v. Richard Gibbs, Caso OMPI N\u00b0 D2004-0363, o en Dial-A-Mattress Operating Corp. v.

In particular, the disputed domain name <xn--nauticatrkiyesale-92b.com> incorporates Complainant's mark in its entirety and adds the geographic identifier \"trkiye\" (T\u00fcrkiye), the descriptive term \"sale,\" nondistinctive elements such as the letters \"xn,\" a dash, the number \"92,\" and the letter \"b.\" Therefore, the Panel finds that the disputed domain names are confusingly similar to Complainant's NAUTICA mark under Policy \u00b6 4(a)(i).\n  Rights or Legitimate Interests\nComplainant must first make a prima facie case that Respondent lacks rights and legitimate interests in the disputed domain name under Policy \u00b6 4(a)(ii), then the burden shifts to Respondent to show it does have rights or legitimate interests. See Advanced International Marketing Corporation v. AA-1 Corp, FA 780200 (Forum Nov. 2, 2011) (finding that a complainant must offer some evidence to make its prima facie case and satisfy Policy \u00b6 4(a)(ii)); see also Neal & Massey Holdings Limited v. Gregory Ricks, FA 1549327 (Forum Apr. 12, 2014) (\"Under Policy \u00b6 4(a)(ii), Complainant must first make out a prima facie case showing that Respondent lacks rights and legitimate interests in respect of an at-issue domain name and then the burden, in effect, shifts to Respondent to come forward with evidence of its rights or legitimate interests.\").\n  Complainant claims Respondent does not have rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names as Respondent is not licensed or authorized to use Complainant's NAUTICA mark and is not commonly known by the disputed domain names. Where a response is lacking, WHOIS information may be used to determine whether a respondent is commonly known by the disputed domain name under Policy \u00b6 4(c)(ii). See State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Dale Anderson, FA 1613011 (Forum May 21, 2015) (concluding that because the WHOIS record lists \"Dale Anderson\" as the registrant of the disputed domain name, the respondent was not commonly known by the <statefarmforum.com> domain name pursuant to Policy \u00b6 4(c)(ii)). Additionally, lack of authorization to use a complainant's mark may indicate that the respondent is not commonly known by the disputed domain name. See Alaska Air Group, Inc. and its subsidiary, Alaska Airlines v. Song Bin, FA 1574905 (Forum Sept. 17, 2014) (holding that the respondent was not commonly known by the disputed domain name as demonstrated by the WHOIS information and based on the fact that the complainant had not licensed or authorized the respondent to use its ALASKA AIRLINES mark). The WHOIS information for the disputed domain names lists the registrant as \"Zhang Qiang.\" There is nothing in the records to suggest that Respondent is commonly known by the disputed domain names. Therefore, the Panel finds Respondent is not commonly known by the disputed domain names pursuant to Policy \u00b6 4(c)(ii).\n  Complainant also argues Respondent does not use the disputed domain names for any bona fide offering of goods or services or legitimate noncommercial or fair use. Instead, the disputed domain names resolve to an error message \"access denied.\" Failure to make active use of a disputed domain name indicates a respondent does not use the domain for a bona fide offering of goods or services or legitimate noncommercial or fair use under Policy \u00b6\u00b6 4(c)(i) or (iii). See Morgan Stanley v. Francis Mccarthy / Baltec Marine Llc, FA 1785347 (Forum June 8, 2018) (\"both Domain Names resolve to a web site that shows the words, 'Not Found, The requested URL / was not found on this server.' Inactive holding of a domain name does not qualify as a bona fide offering of goods or services within the meaning of Policy \u00b6 4(c)(i), or a legitimate non-commercial or fair use within the meaning of Policy \u00b6 4(c)(iii).\"). Complainant provides a screenshot of each of the disputed domain names that resolves to an error message. Therefore, the Panel finds that Respondent is not using the domain names for a bona fide offering of goods or services under Policy \u00b6 4(c)(i) or a legitimate noncommercial or fair use under Policy \u00b6 4(c)(iii).\n  The Panel finds that Complainant has made out a prima facie case that arises from the considerations above. All of these matters go to make out the prima facie case against Respondent. As Respondent has not filed a Response or attempted by any other means to rebut the prima facie case against it, the Panel finds that Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names.\n  Registration and Use in Bad Faith\nComplainant asserts Respondent registered and uses the disputed domain names in bad faith. Respondent contends that the current status of the domain names (presenting an \"access denied\" message) does not prevent a finding of bad faith, given Respondent's failure to participate in this proceeding, and Respondent's attempt to corner the market in respect of domain names involving the NAUTICA trademark. As noted above Complainant provides a screenshot of each of the disputed domain names, which resolves to a webpage with an error message.\n  The Panel agrees that the passive holding of a domain name does not necessarily circumvent a finding that the domain name is being used in bad faith within the requirements of paragraph 4(a)(iii) of the Policy.  See Telstra Corporation Limited v. Nuclear Marshmallows, WIPO Case No. D2000-0003 (finding that in considering whether the passive holding of a domain name, following a bad faith registration of it, satisfies the requirements of paragraph 4(a)(iii), the panel must give close attention to all the circumstances of the respondent's behavior, and a remedy can be obtained under the Policy only if those circumstances show that the respondent's passive holding amounts to acting in bad faith). \n  The particular circumstances of this case that the Panel has considered are:\n  i) Complainant's mark NAUTICA is a globally famous lifestyle brand for men, women, and children. Since Complainant was established in 1983, the NAUTICA brand has been used in connection with a wide variety of branded goods and services, including clothing, accessories and home goods, which are now sold in over 200 NAUTICA stores and select department stores in over 65 countries, as well as on the NAUTICA website. The NAUTICA brand is supported by a vast portfolio of intellectual property rights, including a large portfolio of copyrights for images used in association with the advertising, marketing and sale of NAUTICA-brand products globally, and a global portfolio of more than 1,400 trademarks covering a wide variety of goods and services. Moreover, Complainant spends millions of dollars marketing its goods and services globally, using the NAUTICA trademarks, and has undertaken extensive efforts to protect its name and enforce such trademarks;\n  ii) Respondent registered 21 domain names incorporating Complainant's mark thereby attempting to corner the market in respect of the disputed domain names involving the NAUTICA trademark; and\n  iii) Respondent has provided no evidence whatsoever of any actual or contemplated good faith use by it of the disputed domain names.\n  Taking into account all of the above, the Panel concludes that Respondent's passive holding of the disputed domain names constitutes bad faith use and registration under Policy, paragraph 4(a)(iii) and that Respondent registered and uses the disputed domain names in bad faith.\n  Complainant further argues that Respondent was likely well aware of Complainant's trademark at the time Respondent registered the disputed domain names as Complainant's mark was and is well-known around the world. While constructive notice is not sufficient for a finding of bad faith, under Policy \u00b6 4(a)(iii), actual knowledge is enough in demonstrating bad faith, and may be established through incorporation of a well-known/registered mark into a domain name. See Custom Modular Direct LLC v. Custom Modular Homes Inc., FA 1140580 (Forum Apr. 8, 2008) (\"There is no place for constructive notice under the Policy.\"); see also iFinex Inc. v. xu shuaiwei, FA 1760249 (Forum Jan. 1, 2018) (\"Respondent's prior knowledge is evident from the notoriety of Complainant's BITFINEX trademark as well as from Respondent's use of its trademark laden domain name to direct internet traffic to a website which is a direct competitor of Complainant\"). The Panel infers, due to the notoriety of Complainant's mark and the manner of Respondent's registering 21 domain names incorporating Complainant's mark that Respondent had knowledge of Complainant's rights in the NAUTICA mark prior to the registration of the disputed domain names, which supports a finding of bad faith registration under Policy \u00b6 4(a)(iii).\n  DECISION\nHaving established all three elements required under the ICANN Policy, the Panel concludes that relief shall be GRANTED.\n  Accordingly, it is Ordered that the <nauticaargentinastore.com>, <nauticabelgique.com>, <nauticabelgiumsale.com>, <nauticabulgaria.com>, <nauticachilestore.com>, <nauticacolombiaoutlet.com>, <nauticaczstore.com>, <nauticaeesti.com>, <nauticagreeceoutlet.com>, <nauticahrvatskasale.com>, <nauticaisraelstore.com>, <nauticajapan.com>, <nauticakuwait.com>, <xn--nauticatrkiyesale-92b.com>, <nauticaespa\u00f1a.com>, <nauticauruguaysale.com>, <nauticauaesale.com>, <nauticasuisse.com>, <nauticastoreschweiz.com>, <nauticastorehungary.com> and <nauticasrbija.com> domain names be TRANSFERRED from Respondent to Complainant.\n      ": [

"Espa\u00f1a, no puede alegar desconocimiento de la marca y nombre comercial CORPORACION BANESTO por ser esta reconocida marca y nombre comercial de la Demandante. En particular, no le es posible negar el car\u00e1cter ajeno de esa marca y de la expresi\u00f3n BANESTO, que en Espa\u00f1a distingue al Banco de Cr\u00e9dito Espa\u00f1ol, S.A., goza de reputaci\u00f3n y es notoria. Ver Caso OMPI D2000-0018 Banco Espa\u00f1ol de Cr\u00e9dito, S.A. v. Miguel Duarte Perry Vidal Taveira.\nEl Demandado dice que \"corporacionbanesto\" es el nombre de su mascota, sin allegar prueba alguna de que posee una mascota, ni ilustrar al Panel sobre las razones o motivos que pudiera haber tenido para dar ese curioso nombre a un animal. Simult\u00e1neamente afirma querer hacer en el futuro un uso no comercial del dominio, pero tampoco ilustra al Panel con dato concreto alguno al respecto. Carece en suma de todo derecho o inter\u00e9s leg\u00edtimo sobre el nombre de dominio, por lo que cualquier uso que pueda hacer del dominio dif\u00edcilmente lo pueda ser de buena fe.\nLa permanente inactividad del nombre de dominio, pr\u00e1cticamente id\u00e9ntico a la marca de la Demandante, bloquea e impide de hecho el acceso a la Internet a la Demandante bajo el nombre de dominio gen\u00e9rico del nivel superior \".com\", e induce a pensar a los navegantes de la Red, incluidos los clientes actuales o potenciales de la Demandante, que esta no posee un sitio web, o que no es t\u00e9cnicamente capaz de mantenerlo.\nDichas circunstancias en conjunto conducen a este Panel a concluir que el Demandado usa de mala fe el nombre de dominio en el sentido de la Pol\u00edtica, Par\u00e1grafo 4(a)(iii).\n  7. Resoluci\u00f3n\nEl Panel considera que la Demandante ha probado que el nombre de dominio es pr\u00e1cticamente id\u00e9ntico o por lo menos confundiblemente similar a la marca de la Demandante, que el Demandado carece de derechos o intereses leg\u00edtimos respecto del nombre de dominio, y que este ha sido registrado y se usa de mala fe.\nPor ello, y conforme a la Pol\u00edtica, Par\u00e1grafo 4(i) y al Reglamento, Par\u00e1grafo 15, el Panel resuelve que el registro del nombre de dominio <corporacionbanesto.com>": [

The history and business of the Complainant in the banking and wine industries can be traced back over two hundred years.\nThe Complainant and other members of the Rothschild Group are the respective owners and registered proprietors of the registered Trademarks for ROTHSCHILD, BARONS DE ROTHSCHILD, BARON PHILIPPE DE ROTHSCHILD and DOMAINES BARONS DE ROTHSCHILD LAFITE in more than 50 countries all over the world. The majority of the Trademarks are registered for \u201cbanking, financial management and investment, trusteeship and securities brokerage services\u201d or wine and goods related to wine. The Complainant Rothschild Group is widely-known for using \u201cBaron\u201d in the course of trade, as is evidenced by the titles of its chairmen and the BARONS DE ROTHSCHILD, BARON PHILIPPE DE ROTHSCHILD and DOMAINES BARONS DE ROTHSCHILD LAFITE Trademarks. The Complainant Rothschild Group is also widely-known for its use of \u201cde Rothschild\u201d, which the Second and Third Complainants and other members of the Rothschild Group use in trade. They would be entitled to Germanicise their title if they were resident in a German-speaking country. Accordingly, they would be known by the name \u201cvon Rothschild\u201d, \u201cvon\u201d being the German translation of the French word \u201cde\u201d.\nThe Trademarks, including the title \u201cBaron\u201d, are widely known in connection with the Rothschild Group. The Rothschild Group is famous for its wines and has been at the centre of the world\u2019s financial markets for over two hundred years. The Rothschild Group has invested substantial sums of money in developing and marketing its wines, banking and business services under the Trademarks. In particular, the Rothschild Group advertises and markets its goods and services on websites with the following URLs: http://www.rothschild.com, http://www.rothschildbank.com, http://www.baronphilippederothschild.com, and http://www.lafite.com.\nThe Respondent registered the disputed domain names recently between 2001 and 2006 whilst the Complainant has registered and used the Trademarks long before the Respondent\u2019s registrations.\n5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\nIdentical or Confusingly Similar\nThe Complainant contends that the disputed domain names are confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s ROTHSCHILD Trademarks for the following reasons:\n(a) In relation to the disputed domain name <rothschildbanks.com>\nThe Complainant contends that the disputed domain name is a combination of the name ROTHSCHILD, which is identical to the ROTHSCHILD Trademark, and the word \u201cbanks\u201d, which describes banking services, one of the principal services provided by the Complainant. N M Rothschild & Sons Limited v. Corporate Internet Design Limited and Michael Decker, WIPO Case No. D2001-0854 was cited by the Complainant, in which the Panel held that in relation to the domain names <rothschilds-bank.com> and <rothschilds-bank.net>, \u201cthe addition of the ordinary word \u201cbank\u201d which is descriptive of the business in which the Complainant operates does not prevent the domain names from being confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s ROTHSCHILD trademark.\u201d The Complainant also cited N. M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd. v. Fine Art Investments Ltd., WIPO Case No. D2001-1029 in which it was held that \u201cthe addition to \u201crothschild\u201d of the word \u201cbank\u201d in relation to the domain name <rothschildbank.org>, is purely descriptive of the Complainant\u2019s widely-known activity. As such, the domain name is manifestly confusingly similar to the Trademark.\u201d\n(b) In relation to the disputed domain names <baronvonrothchild.com> and <baronvonrothschild.com>\nThe Complainant contends that these domain names are a combination of the mark ROTHSCHILD and the word \u201crothchild\u201d, and also the words \u201cbaronvon\u201d. These words are also extremely similar to the BARONS DE ROTHSCHILD Trademark. The Complainant contends that the omission of the letter \u201cS\u201d from the middle of the mark ROTHSCHILD is not aurally or visually significant. In support of this contention, the Complainant cites Rothschild Bank AG, N M Rothschild & Sons Limited and Rothschilds Continuation Holdings AG v. Rothchild Corporation and Rothchild Internet Development Corporation SA de CV/Joseph Martin Rothchild, WIPO Case No. D2001-1112 in which it was held that the only difference between <rothchild.com>, <rothchild.net> and <rothchild.org> and the Trademark ROTHSCHILD was the omission of the letter \u201cS\u201d. The Panel was of the opinion that these three disputed domain names represented \u201cwhat is likely to be a common misspelling of the Complainants\u2019 trademark and trade name\u201d. Furthermore, the use of \u201cbaronvon\u201d renders these domain names even more confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s Trademarks because (i) the Rothschild Group has long been associated with the title \u201cBaron\u201d; (ii) some of the Trademarks (and, in particular, the BARONS DE ROTHSCHILD Trademark) incorporate \u201cBaron\u201d and \u201cde\u201d; and (iii) the titles \u201cBaron de\u201d (which is merely the French translation of \u201cBaron von\u201d) and \u201cBaron von\u201d are and have been used (and are entitled to be used) by members of the Rothschild Group in trade. Finally, the Complainant contends that even if \u201cbaronvon\u201d was not distinctive, these domain names would be confusingly similar to their Trademarks.\n(c) In relation to the disputed domain name <rothschildseurope.com>\nThe Complainant contends that this is a combination of the name \u201crothschilds\u201d (which is virtually identical to ROTHSCHILD because the addition of the letter \u201cS\u201d is not aurally or visually significant and is a mere plural of the ROTHSCHILD name and the word \u201ceurope\u201d, which is merely a descriptive geographical indicator. The Complainant cites N M Rothschild & Sons Limited v. Corporate Internet Design Limited and Michael Decker, WIPO Case No. D2001-0854 in which it was held that the \u201cplural or possessive version of the Complainant\u2019s ROTHSCHILD mark\u201d and the word \u201cbank\u201d \u201cdid not prevent the domain names <rothschilds-bank.com> and <rothschilds-bank.net> from being confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s ROTHSCHILD Trademark\u201d. The Complainant also cites NIKE, Inc. v. Jaeik Jung, WIPO Case No. D2000-1471 in which it was held, in relation to the domain names <nikeeurope.com>, <nike-europe.com>, <nikeurope.com> and <euronike.com>, that \u201c[g]eographical additions do not alter the underlying meaning of a domain name, so as to avoid confusing similarity\u201d.\nRights or Legitimate Interests\nThe Complainant asserts that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names. There is no relationship between the Respondent and the Complainants. The Complainants have not licensed or otherwise permitted the Respondent to use their name or the Trademarks or to register a domain name incorporating any of them. Furthermore, there is no suggestion that the Respondent is commonly known as \u201crothschildbanks\u201d, \u201cbaronvonrothschild\u201d, \u201cbaronvonrothchild\u201d or \u201crothschildseurope\u201d or that it has acquired any trademark rights in any of those names.\nThe Respondent has not used (or made demonstrable preparations to use) the Domain Names in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services before receiving notice of this dispute from the Complainant on February 2, 2006. As of July 20, 2006, the Respondent was using the URL <rothschildbanks.com> to display sponsored links relating to, among other things, finance. At some time between July 20, 2006 and August 1, 2006, more than two and a half years following registration of the <rothschildbanks.com> Domain Name in 2003, the Respondent amended the content of the Banks Website so that it displays information relating to the \u201cThe Rothschild Banking Family in England\u201d which, the Banks Website states, has been retrieved from \u201cwww.wikipedia.org\u201d. It is submitted that the Respondent\u2019s display of this content on the Banks Website is no basis for a finding of rights or legitimate interests because it took place after the Respondent had been notified of the dispute. Neither does it relate to an offering of goods or services, nor is it bona fide because the content is, in all material respects, a mere copy of content from the \u201cwww.wikipedia.org\u201d website that involved no monetary or intellectual investment by the Respondent. As such, it is submitted that the Respondent has placed this content on the Banks Website in a superficial attempt to show a legitimate interest in the <rothschildbanks.com> Domain Name in the context of these proceedings. See DHL Operations B.V. v. Ali Kazempour, WIPO Case No. D2004-1094; CBS Broadcasting Inc. f/k/a CBS Inc. v. Goldmark, WIPO Case No. D2004-0330; Corinthians Licenciamentos LTDA v. David Sallen, Sallen Enterprises, and J.D. Sallen Enterprises, WIPO Case No. D2000-0461; and Microsoft Corporation v. StepWeb, WIPO Case No. D2000-1500.\nThe URLs <baronvonrothschild.com> and <baronvonrothchild.com> were used to display sponsored links relating to, among other things, finance and wine. The Respondent has no bona fide interest in \u201cbaronvonrothschild\u201d or \u201cbaronvonrothchild\u201d, especially in relation to finance or wine. At some time between July 20, 2006, and August 1, 2006, the Respondent took down the content of the <baronvonrothschild.com> website. In respect of the inactive website, the Respondent cannot show any use of the <baronvonrothschild.com> Domain Name in connection with goods or services, bona fide or otherwise.\nIn relation to website with the URL <rothschildseurope.com>, it was used to display a history of the \u201cMayer Amschel Rothschild family\u201d, which, the Europe Website states, has been retrieved from \u201cwww.wikipedia.org\u201d. It is submitted that the Respondent\u2019s display of this content on the Europe Website is no basis for a finding of rights or legitimate interests because, given that the Respondent registered the <rothschildseurope.com> Domain Name on June 23, 2006, it took place after the Respondent had been notified of the dispute. Neither does it relate to an offering of goods or services, nor is it bona fide because the content is, in all material respects, a mere copy of content from the \u201cwww.wikipedia.org\u201d website that involved no monetary or intellectual investment by the Respondent. As such, it is submitted that the Respondent has placed this content on the Europe Website (as it did for the Banks Website) in a superficial attempt to show a legitimate interest in the Europe Domain Name in anticipation of these proceedings.\nThe Complainant further contends that the Respondent is not making any legitimate non-commercial or fair use of the Domain Names because of the following reasons:\n(i) The websites display sponsored links which are commercial and it is submitted that the Respondent\u2019s motive for registering them was to obtain a commercial benefit by using names confusingly similar to the famous Trademarks; and\n(ii) The websites which display information about the Rothschild family are commercial because the Respondent has described one of the websites as producing \u201can income stream\u2026on monetization of that name\u201d with \u201can income approach of well over $50,000\u201d and the other website as a \u201crevenue builder\u201d which receives \u201ctremendous traffic\u201d and which it would be prepared to sell for USD5,000.\nRegistered and Used in Bad Faith\nThe Complainant submits that the disputed domain names have been registered and are being used in bad faith for the following reasons:\n(a) The Respondent has registered the disputed domain names primarily for the purpose of selling them to the Complainant for valuable consideration in excess of Respondent\u2019s documented out-of-pocket costs. The Complainant has adduced evidence to show that the Respondent has made an unsolicited offer to sell the one of the disputed domain names <rothschildbanks.com> for the price of USD12, 500. After a series of email correspondences of offers and counter-offers between the parties, during which the Respondent registered the other three domain names of <baronvonrothchild.com>; <baronvonrothschild.com>; and <rothschildseurope.com>, the Respondent was willing to sell all four domain names to the Complainant for the price of USD12, 500. The Complainant asserts that through all these correspondences the Respondent has demonstrated its intention to sell the disputed domain names to the Complainant for a sum vastly in excess of its out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain names.\n(b) The Respondent has offered for sale the domain names <baronvonrothchild.com> and <baronvonrothschild.com> on its websites. The Complainant asserts that each of the Respondent\u2019s\u2019 websites contained, as of July 20, 2006, a statement that it is for sale and inviting Internet users to make an offer via a hyperlink. That hyperlink directed users to websites where they were invited to make an offer for the relevant domain name, which the websites stated \u201cmust exceed $400\u201d.\n(c) The Respondent has engaged in a pattern of registrations which prevent the owner of a Trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name. The Complainant has adduced evidence in the form of an email which demonstrated the Respondent\u2019s opportunistic approach to domain name registration in which it indicated that the Complainants have \u201cbeen highly remiss to have missed the boat years ago by not registering\u201d the Banks Domain Name.\n(d) The Respondent intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to the websites of the domain names by creating a likelihood of confusion with the Complainant\u2019s\u2019 Trademarks as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of the websites.\n(e) As of July 20, 2006, the Respondent was using the \u201crothschildbanks.com\u201d website homepage to display sponsored links to websites for a \u201cdating service\u201d and \u201cRussian mail order bride\u201d. The Respondent\u2019s use of the <rothschildbanks.com> domain name was likely to misleadingly divert customers wishing to visit one of the Complainant\u2019s websites to the Respondent \u201crothschildbanks.com\u201d website, which contains links to inappropriate material. As a result, those customers may (wrongly) associate the Complainant with that material, thereby tarnishing the Complainant\u2019s good reputation.\nB. Respondent": [

Under that provision, the Respondent is only required to demonstrate one of the following circumstances (in particular and without limitation) to prove its rights to or legitimate interest in the domain name:\n(1) before any notice of the dispute is given to Respondent, its use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services; or\n(2) Respondent (as an individual, business, or other organization) has been commonly known by the domain name, even if it has acquired no trademark or service mark rights; or\n(3) Respondent is making a legitimate non-commercial or fair use of the domain name, without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue.\nAd (1):\nContrary to the majority of the Panel, I find that, in the present case, Respondent has not established that it made, prior to the lodging of the present claim by Complainant, any use or any demonstrable preparations to use the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services.\nIt cannot be contested that Complainant has a priority registration in the home country of the Respondent (the United Arab Emirates) since February 6, 1994, that is before the domain name <stmoritz.com> was registered on September 24, 1998.\nRespondent has not offered any evidence that there was a bona fide offering of goods and services by Respondent before it received the Complainant\u2019s request on February 3, 2004. It results from the documents filed that the Respondent started to use the domain name <stmoritz.com> only after it received notice of the dispute.\nSince the Panel finds that the website forming the object of the present complaint constitutes a ground for a \u201ctruly new action\u201d, the website of the prior Respondent is to be considered to have been essentially different, and therefore the use, in the year 2000, of a different website by Respondent\u2019s predecessor cannot constitute a \u201cbona fide offering of services prior to the lodging of the present complaint\u201d by Respondent for the present proceedings.\nAd (2):": [

"Palestine-Israel (1), Georgia (7), Iraq (7), Israel (1), Kazakhstan (1), Cyprus (4), Mongolia (1) , \nand Jordan (1). \n \nThe Complainant is the owner of a number of trademark registrations for the term \u201cDAG \u0130\u201d.  Most, if not all, of \nthese appear to be for the term \u201cDAG\u0130\u201d in stylised form - see for example United States trademark serial no. \n79202023 and registration no. 5332114, registered on November 14, 2017.  These trademarks are referred \nto in this decision as the DAGI trademarks.  The DAG\u0130 trademark has been recognised as \u201cwell known\u201d by a \ndecision numbered T/02461 of the Turkish Patent and Trademark Office.  It is not entirely clear but it \nappears that the earliest of the DAG\u0130 trademarks was registered in 1987 but was allowed to lapse.  It \nappears from the online records of the Turkish Patent and Trademark Office, that the Complainant\u2019s earliest \nduly renewed trademark dates back to 2009.  The Respondent also owns a number of further trademarks \nwhich include the term DAGI as part of the trademark but the Panel has not found it necessary to consider \nthese in any detail. \n \nThe Complainant\u2019s principal website is linked to the domain name <dagi.com.tr> which it registered in 1997.  \n \nThe Disputed Domain Name was registered on": [

This name does not identify any company, product or service for which the Respondent may be known, so that the same does not have any right or legal interest to use the name CRUZCAMPO when identifying the products or services. In addition, since the time of registration, Respondent\u2019s web site has been under construction and he does not appear to have started a legitimate business in the field.\nThe Complainant states that the Domain Name was registered in bad faith, with the only aim of obtaining financial benefit by trying to invite the Complainant to make a financial offer to the Respondent to change the Domain Name. CRUZCAMPO is a particularly famous brand name in the beer field; the activities of the Complainant cover the geographic area including the seat of the Respondent at the time the Domain Name was registered (Gibraltar is located in the south coast of Spain": [

"Puerto Rico, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, United States of America, Uruguay and Venezuela (unnumbered Annex to the Complaint).\nThe Complainant is the owner, inter alia, of the domain names <bradescointernetbanking.com.br> (unnumbered Annex to the Complaint) and <bradesco.com.br> (unnumbered Annex to the Complaint).\n5. Parties' Contentions\nA. Complainant\nThe Complainant is the principal company of the second largest privately-owned enterprise in Brazil, the BRADESCO Group of companies. The Complainant began its operations in 1943 in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (Marilia) under the name of Banco Brasileiro de Descontos S/A. Since that time, its activities have expanded and it acquired numerous other banks, reaching over 1000 agencies by the end of the 1980's. For the year 2006, the total net worth of the Complainant and its affiliates was valued at R$24,636 billion, with total assets in the range of R$265 billion.\nThe Banker Magazine (unnumbered Annex to the Complaint), and Brand Finance Global Banking 500 (unnumbered Annex to the Complaint), two leading financial magazines, rated Bradesco as the most valuable branding segment in Latin America. Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2009 named Bradesco the top bank in Brazil (unnumbered Annex to the Complaint). Bradesco was included for the first time in 2009 among the BrandZ Top100 Most Valuable Global Brands (unnumbered Annex to the Complaint).\nThe Mark (BRADESCO) was derived from the initial name of the bank, Banco BRAsileiro de DESCOntos S/A over 60 years ago. The Mark is the subject of a large number of registrations and applications both in Brazil and in numerous countries throughout the world. As such, the Mark is well-known both in Brazil and abroad.\nThe Respondent registered the Domain Names on August 18, 2009 and August 25, 2009, respectively. From the moment of their registration, the sole purpose for the registration has been to profit unjustly from the reputation of the Mark and the activities of the Complainant. It has done so by using the Domain Names to lure surfers and clients of the Complainant to input their banking data by means of use of a phishing scam. \u201cPhishing\u201d has been described by one Panel as follows:\n\u201cPhishing' is a form of Internet fraud that aims to steal valuable information such as credit cards, social security numbers, user IDs, passwords etc. A fake website is created that is similar to that of a legitimate organization, typically a financial institution such as a bank or insurance company and this information is used to identify theft or other nefarious activities.\u201d Sanofi Aventis, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme v. Balata.com Ltd., WIPO Case No. DNL2008-0014)\nMore particularly, the Respondent has used the Domain Names to direct Complaint's customers to false pages that give the impression that they are connected with the Respondent. It does so by reproducing the Complainant's website. Other than this, no webpage for either of the Domain Names was found. The purpose of so doing is to entice clients of the Respondent to disclose private confidential data about themselves.\nShortly after registration of the Domain Names, on August 21, 2009, and September 14, 2009, respectively, the Respondent sent warning letters to the host server identified for the respective IP addresses, advising that the Domain Names were being used for unlawful phishing activities (unnumbered Annex to the Complaint). On the same respective dates, email communications were sent to the registrar, requesting that it block the Domain Names (unnumbered Annex to the Complaint).\nKnowledge of the Complainant's rights may be presumed because the Mark is a registered mark that has been designated as notorious by the BNIIP. The Mark is identified with one of the best-known banking organizations in Latin America. The very use of the Domain Names to exploit the Marks in order to enable the Respondent to carry out its unlawful activities shows that the Respondent had knowledge of the Marks. Moreover, the Respondent does not have any registration or application, including on either the Argentine PTO or the BPTO for BRADESCO ALTERAS, or BRADESCO INTERNET BANKING, or any other registered mark or application containing the word \u201cBRADESCO\u201d.\nThe Respondent also had actual knowledge of the Complainant's rights. Counsel for the Respondent sent email communications to the Respondent on September 11, 2009 (unnumbered Annex to the Complaint) and January 6, 2010 (unnumbered Annex to the Complaint). These communications set out the Complainant's ownership of the Mark and the applicable law that grants to the Complainant exclusive rights therein. The Respondent was requested to immediate stop all use of the Mark in the Domain Names. No response to these communications was received": [

Therefore, the Panel finds that Respondent\u2019s disputed domain names are confusingly similar to Complainant\u2019s THERMADOR mark.\n  The Panel finds that Complainant has satisfied Policy \u00b6 4(a)(i).\n  Rights or Legitimate Interests\nOnce Complainant makes a prima facie case that Respondent lacks rights and legitimate interests in the disputed domain name under Policy \u00b6 4(a)(ii), the burden shifts to Respondent to show it does have rights or legitimate interests. See Advanced International Marketing Corporation v. AA-1 Corp, FA 780200 (Forum Nov. 2, 2011) (finding that a complainant must offer some evidence to make its prima facie case and satisfy Policy \u00b6 4(a)(ii)); see also Neal & Massey Holdings Limited v. Gregory Ricks, FA 1549327 (Forum Apr. 12, 2014) (\u201cUnder Policy \u00b6 4(a)(ii), Complainant must first make out a prima facie case showing that Respondent lacks rights and legitimate interests in respect of an at-issue domain name and then the burden, in effect, shifts to Respondent to come forward with evidence of its rights or legitimate interests\u201d).\n  Complainant argues that Respondent lacks rights and legitimate interest in the disputed domain name because Respondent is not commonly known by the disputed domain name.

Service Agreement was in effect; (6) the domain name registration ARMANIEXCHANGE.NET was in \"Active\" status.\nThe policy in effect provides that: \"8. DOMAIN NAME DISPUTE POLICY. If you reserved or registered a domain name through us, you agree to be bound by our current domain name dispute policy that is incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement by reference. The current version of the dispute policy may be found at our Web site: www.networksolutions.com/legal/dispute-policy.html. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with that policy.\"\nIn light of the above and according to the documents filed with the Panel, the Complaint appears to have been filed in accordance with the requirements of the World Intellectual Property Organization Supplemental Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (hereinafter the \"Supplemental Rules\").\nThe only deficiency appears to be the lack of acknowledgement by the Registrar of a copy of the Complaint. As already stated in my previous decision D2000-0493 of July 7, 2000, Pomellato S.p.A v. Richard Tonetti (to which I remand for reason of brevity) such deficiency does not seem capable per se of invalidating the Complaint, being a minor formality (the WIPO itself calls it \"a courtesy copy\").\nWith respect to all other requirements, the Panel finds that the payment was properly made and agrees with the WIPO Center\u2019s assessment concerning the Complaint\u2019s compliance with the formal requirements: the Complaint was properly notified to the Respondent in accordance with paragraph 2(a) of the Rules, on June 13, 2000, but since a response was not filed, on July 24, 2000 the WIPO Center communicated to the Respondent a Notification of Default.

Respondent's activities\n  Since the date she registered all three disputed domain names, Respondent has not used any of them in conjunction with an operative web site.\n  Respondent has parked all these domain names with the Registrar which, in turn, uses these names to resolve to corresponding home pages, each of which displays sponsored link advertising and offers search boxes.

"Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Trinidad ad Tobago, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America and Uruguay (Annex F-2).\n4.8 In addition to the foregoing, the Complainant is also owner of the domain names \u201cbradesco.com.br\u201d and \u201cbradesco.com\u201d, among other domains containing \u201cBRADESCO\u201d (Annexes G and G-1).\n5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\n5.1 The Complainant asserts that the Respondent, however, registered the disputed domain name <sacbradescoonline.com> on May 15, 2013 (Annex D-1).\n5.2 The Complainant contends that it is evident that the domain name at issue <sacbradescoonline.com> is confusingly similar to the BRADESCO trademark, to which the Complainant has prior and unencumbered rights.\n5.3 The Complainant claims that the <sacbradescoonline.com> domain name reproduces the Complainant\u2019s trademark BRADESCO, registered in Brazil under No. 007.170.424, and is confusingly similar to the domain names previously registered by the Complainant.\n5.4 The Complainant argues that the <sacbradescoonline.com> domain name is composed by the terms \u201csac\u201d, the Complainant\u2019s trademark BRADESCO, and \u201conline\u201d. \u201cSAC\u201d is the abbreviation in Portuguese for \u201cServi\u00e7o de Atendimento ao Cliente\u201d, which means \u201cDepartment of Customer Service\u201d in English. This leads to the conclusion that the <sacbradescoonline.com> domain name is confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademarks, leading customers to believe that the disputed domain name is the real and current Complainant\u2019s domain name, which is not true.\n5.5 Moreover, the Complainant asserts that it is one of the leaders of the private financial activity in Brazil, and is the owner of the BRADESCO trademark in 38 countries. The Complainant offers banking services under the BRADESCO trademark, to individuals and business companies, which makes it clear that the <sacbradescoonline.com\u201d> domain name is confusingly similar with the Complainant\u2019s trademarks and domain names.\n5.6 Thus the Complainant argues that the possibility of confusion is evident given that consumers will immediately identify the disputed domain name registered by the Respondent with the Complainant\u2019s notorious trademark, believing that both registrations identify the same company, and that the products/services offered under that name originate from the same source - what is not true given the undue registration made by the Respondent.\n5.7 The Complainant argues that the highly renown trademark BRADESCO has been registered since 1980 in Brazil, at least 33 years before Respondent registered the disputed domain name.\n5.8. Furthermore, the Complainant alleges that there is no trademark registered, in the name of the Respondent, that consists of, or contains, the word \u201cbradesco\u201d, or that it has any rights on an unregistered basis in such a mark. The Complainant has not entered in any agreement, authorization or license with the Respondent with respect to the use of the BRADESCO mark.\n5.9. The Complainant insists that \u201cbradesco\u201d is not a generic term, nor descriptive of the Complainant\u2019s products, and is not a dictionary word in the Portuguese, English, French or Italian languages. \u201cBRADESCO\u201d is a coined word created by the joining of the first letters of the Complainant\u2019s previous commercial name (Banco BRAsileiro de DESCOntos).\n5.10. Moreover, the Complainant submits that the Respondent\u2019s activities do not relate to the products commercialized under the BRADESCO trademark and Respondent has never been known to be related or associated to said mark. The term \u201cbradesco\u201d does not appear in the Respondent\u2019s denomination, or any other identification.\n5.11 The Complainant asserts that the Respondent seems to have no interest in the disputed domain name <sacbradescoonline.com>, since there is no webpage connected to the disputed domain name. There is no reference to the Respondent\u2019s activities or services. Thus the only plausible explanation for the Respondent\u2019s selection of the domain name is to exploit in an unauthorized fashion the reputation and goodwill of the Complainant and its names and marks.\n5.12. The Complainant also asserts that the bad faith of the Respondent can be evidenced from the Respondent\u2019s use of BRADESCO as a major component of the disputed domain name, in which the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the mark.\n5.13. The Complainant alleges that the trademark BRADESCO is so widely used and known by the public that it would be almost impossible for someone to claim having registered said mark as a domain name without bad faith.\n5.14. Furthermore, the Complainant concludes that all of the aforementioned facts, analyzed separately or in their entirety, lead to the conclusion that the bad faith of the Respondent is incontestable. In similar cases, where the mentioned elements were found present, the panel recognized bad faith of the respondent (Embratel v. Kevin McCarthy, ( WIPO Case No. D2000-0164).\n5.15. The Complainant states that previous UDRP panels have ordered transfer of domain names that comprise of the trademark BRADESCO. For instance, the Complainant notes: Banco Bradesco S/A v. Camila Esteban Oliveira, WIPO Case No. D2011-0037; Banco Bradesco S/A v. Bradescoatualizacao.info Private Registrant, A Happy DreamHost Customer, WIPO Case No. D2010-2108; BANCO BRADESCO S.A. v. Antonio Giudice, WIPO Case No. D2010-1975; Banco Bradesco S/A. v. Joony Climber, WIPO Case No. D2010-1961; Banco Bradesco S.A. v. Samambaia valinhos / bradescoatualizacao.com Private Registrant, WIPO Case No. D2010-1658; BANCO BRADESCO S.A. v. Marcos Soares, WIPO Case No. D2010-1605; Banco Bradesco S.A. v. Sirlandi do N Cruz, WIPO Case No. D2010-1604; Banco Bradesco S.A. v. Noori net, WIPO Case No. D2010-1553; Banco Bradesco S.A. v. Fernando Camacho Bohm, WIPO Case No. D2010-1552; Banco Bradesco S.A. v. Carlos Roberto Batista de Morais, WIPO Case No. D2010-1271; Banco Bradesco S.A. v. Angela Oster, WIPO Case No. D2010-1201; Banco Bradesco S/A v. Martha Dantas, WIPO Case No. D2010-0646; Banco Bradesco S/A. v. Afonso Miranda, WIPO Case No. D2010-0645; Banco Bradesco S.A. v. Marciano Martins, WIPO Case No. D2010-0201; Banco Bradesco S.A. v. FAST-12785241 Attn. Bradescourgente.net / Name Redacted, WIPO Case No. D2009-1788; and Banco Bradesco S.A. v. Rebeca Gurgel, WIPO Case No. D2009-1786.\n5.16 The Complainant finally contends that it has established and proven that the three requirements of paragraphs 4(a)(i)(ii)(iii) of the Policy have been met in the present case, i.e.: that the disputed domain name <sacbradescoonline.com> is confusingly similar to Complainant\u2019s \u201cBRADESCO\u201d trademark, and domain names; that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain name, and that the registration and use of the disputed domain name have been made by the Respondent in bad faith.\nB.

Throughout Canada, there are a number of representatives that sell GREENHECK branded products.\nGreenheck\u2019s GREENHECK marks have been continuously used by Greenheck since at least 1947. Moreover, Greenheck first filed an application for the registration of its GREENHECK trademark with the United States Trademark Office on November 26, 1991. Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK Registration is now incontestable.\nGreenheck has invested substantial sums of money in developing and marketing its products under its GREENHECK Marks and has developed substantial goodwill and customer loyalty under said marks. Greenheck has developed a cross-continental network of Greenheck distributors and representatives, which provide Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK branded products on a global scale. As a result, consumers throughout the world recognize the GREENHECK Mark as an indicator of air movement and control equipment produced by Greenheck.\nRespondent registered the domain names GREENHECK.NET, GREENHECKFAN.NET, GREENHECKVENTILATOR.COM, GREENHECKVENTILATOR.NET. (\u201cGREENHECK Domain Names\u201d) on or about June 25 2013 and July 31, 2013, under Moniker Online Services, LLC\u2019s (\u201cMoniker\u2019s\u201d) domain registration policy.\nRespondent has no statutory or common law trademark rights or any other right or legitimate interest to Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK\u2019S Marks, the marks GREENHECKFAN, GREENHECKVENTILATOR, or in the infringing domain names GREENHECK.NET, GREENHECKFAN.NET, GREENHECKVENTILATOR.COM, or GREENHECKVENTILATOR.NET. Greenheck has not authorized or licensed Respondent to use Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK Marks or any derivative mark for any purpose. Greenheck\u2019s rights in the GREENHECK marks date back to its first date of use 1947. Greenheck first took steps to protect its valuable GREENHECK Marks at least twenty years before Respondent registered the domain name. As such, there is no controversy as to the fact that Greenheck has priority over Respondent.\nRespondent has registered and used a domain name that is confusingly similar to the GREENHECK Marks in bad faith. There is no evidence the domain names were registered for a legitimate reason. The evidence shows the domain names were registered primarily for the purpose of trading off Greenheck\u2019s goodwill for its GREENHECK marks by offering products similar to those sold by Greenheck. Two of the GREENHECK domain names actively promote and sell air movement products that are sold by competitors of Greenheck. The domain name GREENHECK.NET resolves to a website that advertises goods sold by Oleg Blower Company (\u201cOleg.\u201d) The domain name GREENHECKVENTILATOR.COM resolves to a website that advertises goods sold by Blowers Depot.  The goods sold by both Oleg and Blowers Depot directly overlap with those sold by Greenheck. Greenheck is in the business of selling air movement equipment such as fans, ventilators, blowers, and coils. The goods advertised on both Oleg and Blowers\u2019 Depot directly overlap with those sold by Greenheck.\nMoreover, Respondent is redirecting the GREENHECK.NET domain to the website www.abblower.com. Specifically, when a link on the GREENHECK.NET domain is selected, the user is redirected to the domain name. Respondent also owns the domain www.abbblower.com.\nThe domain names GREENHECKVENTILATOR.NET and GREENHECKFAN.NET each resolve to parking pages.  Some of the links on these parking pages resolve to competitors of Greenheck and it appears that Respondent is commercially benefitting on a pay for click basis.\nRespondent\u2019s registration of the GREENHECK Domain Names evidences the bad faith of Respondent. First, Respondent\u2019s use of the Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK mark in the GREENHECK.NET and GREENHECKVENTILATOR.COM domain names illustrates the bad faith intention to pass off on the goodwill associated with Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK Marks by advertising competing air movement products.  Second, Respondent\u2019s redirection of GREENHECKVENTILATOR.COM to www.abbblower.com, a domain also owned by Respondent, on which Respondent sells competing products, likewise evidences the bad faith of Respondent. Third, the GREENHECKFAN.NET and GREENHECKVENTILATOR.NET domains resolve to parking pages that provide links to competitors of Greenheck. Last, Respondent\u2019s registration of four GREENHECK Domain Names evidences Respondent\u2019s bad faith by registering numerous variations of domains that include Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK Marks.\nRespondent\u2019s continuous maintenance of the GREENHECK Domain Names will continue to cause harm to Greenheck unless the domain name is transferred to Greenheck. Respondent has no legitimate interest in the GREENHECK Domain Names. Moreover, Respondent\u2019s continued trafficking of that domain name to pass off on the goodwill associated with Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK Marks is bad faith. Transfer of the domain name to Greenheck is appropriate.\na.                    The GREENHECK Domain Names are Confusingly Similar to Greenheck\u2019s Corporate Name and Trademarks.\n  The GREENHECK Domain Names contain the dominant feature GREENHECK, which is also the dominant feature of the GREENHECK Marks. Additionally, the addition of the suffixes .net and .com do not distract from the overall impression of the domain name. Sony Kabushiki Kaisha v. Inja, Kil, D2000-1409 (WIPO Dec. 9, 2000) (finding that \u201c[n]either the addition of an ordinary descriptive word . . . nor the suffix \u2018.com\u2019 detract from the overall impression of the dominant part of the name in each case, namely the trademark SONY\u201d and  thus Policy \u00b64(a)(i) is satisfied). Incorporation of VENTILATOR and FAN into two of the GREENHECK Domain Names, enhances, rather than detracts from the confusion as ventilators and fans are products that are sold by Greenhouse. Microsoft Corporation v. Wayne Lybrand, WIPO Case No. D2005-0020 (March 18, 2005) (Use of microsoftcustomerservice.com by unauthorized third party likely to cause confusion, in view of the additional descriptive language, since \u201c[t]he addition of such relevant descriptive words reinforces rather than detracts from the conclusion that the Domain Name confusingly refers to the business of Complainant and would likely cause at least some customers to assume that the Domain Name is associated with Complainant.\u201d)\nConsumers are likely to be confused that the websites located at GREENHECK Domain Names are sponsored and/or endorsed by or affiliated with Greenheck and its business.  Greenheck has promoted its goods and services under the GREENHECK Marks since at least as early as 1947. It has offered a variety of air movement products, including ventilators and fans, during that time. It naturally follows that consumers would associate websites located at the GREENHECK Domain Names, which contain the GREENHECK Mark, with Greenheck. This  is especially true with regard to GREENHECK.NET and GREENHECKVENTILATOR.COM, which resolve to websites that sell products commonly sold by Greenheck. See Brookfield Communications Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp., 174 F.3d 1036 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding the content of a website may increase the likelihood of consumer confusion). The requirement of confusing similarity is met.\nb.                    Respondent Does Not Have Any Right or Legitimate Interest in the GREENHECK Domain Names.\n  Respondent does not have any right or legitimate interest in the GREENHECK Domain Names. The registration of a domain for the purpose of redirecting Internet users interested in another\u2019s products is not a bona fide offering of goods pursuant to Policy \u00b64(c)(i). Moreover, Respondent has no legitimate right to the name in that it has not received permission to use the mark pursuant to Policy \u00b64(c)(ii). Furthermore, Respondent is not using the mark for legitimate noncommercial or fair use pursuant to Policy \u00b64(c)(iii) because Respondent is advertising and purportedly selling products of Greenheck\u2019s competitors and to redirect to websites of Greenheck\u2019s competitors.\n1.      Respondent has not used the Domain Name in Connection with a Bona Fide Offering of Goods or Services in that the Intent was to Cause Unsuspecting Consumers to Veer to Its Website and Away from Greenheck\u2019s Legitimate Site.\n  A respondent\u2019s use of a domain name to trick consumers into visiting its website to offer competing products or services is not a bona fide offering of goods or services pursuant to Policy \u00b6(c)(i). See Bank of Am. Corp. v. Nw. Free Cmty. Access, FA 180704 (Forum Sept. 30, 2003) (\u201cRespondent's demonstrated intent to divert Internet users seeking Complainant's website to a website of Respondent and for Respondent's benefit is not a bona fide offering of goods or services under Policy \u00b64(c)(i)).\nRespondent does not have a bona fide interest in the domain name pursuant to Policy \u00b64(c)(i) in that its intent in registering the domain name was to divert traffic away from Greenheck, not to legitimately use the name in connection with the sale of goods. Unsuspecting consumers attempting to visit Greenheck\u2019s website to purchase air movement products likely inadvertently visited Respondent\u2019s sites at the GREENHECK Domain Names they contain the GREENHECK mark. Further, upon arriving at Respondent\u2019s website, those consumers were likely confused because Respondent\u2019s websites at GREENHECK.NET and GREENHECKVENTILATOR.COM sell the same products as sold by Greenheck. Customers visiting the GREENHECKFAN.NET and GREENHECKVENTILATOR.NET websites were likewise diverted when they selected links on the parking page that redirect to competing websites. Customers are likely to think the air movement products offered for sale on the websites hosted at the GREENHECK Domain Names originate from Greenheck. Respondent, in turn, profited off the confusion. The domain name is not connected to a bona fide offering of goods or services and is not a legitimate use.\n2.      Respondent has no Legitimate Right in the Domain Name Because Greenheck has not Granted Respondent Permission to use the Name.\n  Respondent also has no legitimate rights pursuant to Policy \u00b64(c)(ii) in that it is not commonly known by the mark and has not received Greenheck\u2019s permission to use the mark. Compagnie de Saint Gobain v. Com-Union Corp., D2000-0020 (WIPO Mar. 14, 2000) (finding no rights or legitimate interest where respondent was not commonly known by the mark and never applied for a license or permission from complainant to use the trademarked name). A domain name registrant is presumed not to have a legitimate interest in a domain name where (1) Respondent is not a licensee of Complainant; (2) Complainant\u2019s prior rights in the domain name precede Respondent\u2019s registration; and (3) Respondent is not commonly known by the domain name. Policy \u00b64(c)(ii); Gallup, Inc. v. Amish Country Store, FA96209 (Forum Jan. 23, 2001) (holding that Respondent does not have rights in a domain name when Respondent is not known by the mark). Furthermore, it is \u201cincumbent upon respondents to advance concrete evidence pursuant to Policy \u00b64(a)(ii) rebutting the latter assertion because this information is uniquely within the knowledge and control of Respondent.\u201d Wilson v. Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc., FA0502000417186 (Forum March 29, 2005).\nRespondent does not have a legitimate interest in the domain name GREENHECK Domain Names. Greenheck has not licensed its GREENHECK Marks to Respondent. Greenheck\u2019s prior rights to the GREENHECK Marks precede Respondent\u2019s domain name registration. Additionally, there is no evidence Respondent is commonly known by the name GREENHECK. The GREENHECK Domain Names clearly do not refer to Respondent.\n3.      Respondent\u2019s Diversion of Traffic to Another Website is not a Legitimate Use.\n  Respondent is also not using the domain name for a legitimate noncommercial or fair use pursuant to Policy \u00b64(c)(iii) because the name is commercially used to offer competing products to consumers. See RAB Lighting, Inc. v. DNS Support - Ultimate Search, FA0411000363908 (Forum Dec. 30, 2004) (holding that opportunistic use of Complainant\u2019s mark to redirect Internet users to a directory website unrelated to Complainant\u2019s business was not legitimate); DSW Shoe Warehouse, Inc. v. Ultimate Search, FA0501000412381 (Forum March 21, 2005) (holding that use of a domain name to redirect Internet users to a search engine website that provided various links to third parties was not legitimate); See RAB  Lighting, Inc. v. DNS Support - Ultimate Search, FA0411000363908 (Forum Dec. 30, 2004) (holding that opportunistic use of Complainant\u2019s mark to redirect Internet users to a website unrelated to Complainant\u2019s business was not legitimate); Thrifty, Inc. and Thrifty Rent-a- Car System, Inc. v. Airportparkinglots.com, FA0211000129123 (Forum January 2, 2003) (diverting traffic from Complainant is not legitimate and evidence of bad faith); MSNBC Cable, LLC v.\nTysys.com, D2000-1204 (WIPO Dec. 8, 2000) (finding no rights or legitimate interests in the famous MSNBC mark where Respondent attempted to profit using Complainant\u2019s mark by redirecting Internet traffic to its own website).\nRespondent is not making a legitimate, non-commercial, or fair use of the GREENHECK Domain Names in that its purpose in registering and using the domain name is to divert Greenheck\u2019s web traffic to websites that compete with Greenheck. Respondent uses the GREENHECK.NET and GREENHECKVENTILATOR.COM websites to advertise and sells air movement products that are not manufactured by Greenheck. Moreover, the links on the parking pages at GREENHECKFAN.NET AND GREENHECKVENTILATOR.NET connect to websites that offer products not sold by Greenheck. Respondent\u2019s use of GREENHECK in the domain names misappropriates Greenheck\u2019s goodwill and cheats consumers into clicking on Respondent\u2019s website when they think they will see information regarding Greenheck and its GREENHECK brand products.\nc.                    The Domain Name Has Been Registered and Used In Bad Faith\n              Respondent\u2019s registration of a domain name in association with Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK Marks shows the registration was in bad faith. Respondent\u2019s registration of a domain name with the constructive and actual knowledge of Greenheck\u2019s trademark rights in   that name shows bad faith pursuant to Policy \u00b64(b)(ii). Respondent\u2019s has registered four domain names that include the GREENHECK Mark, and this pattern of conduct indicates the bad faith of Respondent under Policy \u00b64(b)(ii). Because Respondent\u2019s website associated with the GREENHECK Domain Name competed directly against Greenheck, Respondent\u2019s registration disrupted the business of a competitor in bad faith pursuant to Policy \u00b64(b)(iii).                                                                           Respondent has also acted in bad faith pursuant to Policy \u00b64(b)(iii) because it has failed to make active use  of the domain names used as parking pages, GREENHECKFAN.NET and GREENHECKVENTILATOR.NET, for an extended period of time. Respondent\u2019s intentional attempt to attract Internet users to its website by using a name that is confusingly similar to Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK Marks is also in violation of Policy \u00b64(b)(iv).\n1.      Respondent Registered the Domain Name in Bad Faith Knowing of Greenheck\u2019s Trademark Rights in the GREENHECK Marks.\n  Respondent\u2019s registration of the GREENHECK Domain Names was in bad faith pursuant to Policy \u00b64(b)(ii) because at the time the name was registered, Respondent was on notice and knew of Greenheck\u2019s rights. \u201c[T]here is a legal presumption of bad faith when [a] Respondent reasonably should have been aware of Complainant\u2019s trademarks, actually or constructively.\u201d Digi Int\u2019l v. DDI Sys., FA124506 (Forum Oct 24, 2002); see also Pavillion Agency, Inc. v. Greenhouse Agency, Ltd., D2000-1221 (WIPO Dec. 4, 2000) (finding that the domain names are so obviously connected with Complainant that the use or registration by anyone other than Complainant suggests opportunistic bad faith); see also Samsonite Corp. v. Colony Holding, FA 94313 (Forum Apr. 17, 2000) (finding that evidence of bad faith includes actual or constructive knowledge of a commonly known mark at the time of registration). Regardless of actual knowledge, a respondent should have conducted a trademark search prior to the registration of the domain name. See Edmunds.com, Inc. v. Ult. Search Inc., WIPO Case D2001-1319 (Feb 1, 2002) (holding the failure to conduct a trademark search considered an element of bad faith).\nRespondent had actual knowledge of Greenheck\u2019s trademark rights in its GREENHECKS Marks prior to the registration of the domain name. There is an obvious connection between the domain name and the GREENHECK marks that registration by anyone other than Greenheck suggests bad faith. In fact, Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK Marks were registered with the United States Trademark Office at the time the domain name was registered. A simple search for \u201cGreenheck\u201d on the site prior to registration of the GREENHECK Domain Names revealed Greenheck\u2019s website and trademark rights. Further, by incorporating the GREENHECK mark into a domain name that is so obviously related to Greenheck\u2019s mark by advertising products that Greenheck also manufactures, Respondent demonstrates knowledge of Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK marks at the time of registration. Further, Respondent was at least on constructive notice of Greenheck\u2019s trademark rights in and to the GREENHECK Marks at the time the name was registered. On that basis alone, Respondent\u2019s registration of a confusingly similar domain name shows bad faith.\n2.      Respondent\u2019s Pattern of Conduct Evidences Bad Faith\n\u201cA \u2018pattern of conduct\u2019 as required in Paragraph 4.b.(ii) typically involves multiple domain names directed against multiple Complainants, but may involve multiple domain names directed against a single Complainant.\u201d See Smoky Mountain Knife Works v. Deon Carpenter, eResolution Case Nos. AF-230ab; Gruner + Jahr Printing & Publishing Co., G + J McCall\u2019s LLC, Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Lucky Charms Entertainment, Inc. v. Savior Baby, WIPO Case No. D2000-1741).\nRespondent has registered four domain names that include the term GREENHECK. Two of these domain names resolve to websites that advertise and sell products that compete with those sold by Greenheck, and the other two of these domain names resolve to parking pages that redirect to websites of competitors of Greenheck. Respondent clearly has evidenced a pattern of conduct that demonstrates bad faith.\n3.      Respondent\u2019s Failure to Actively Use the Domain Name Shows Bad Faith.\nRespondent\u2019s failure to make active use of the domain name shows bad faith. DCI S.A. v. Link Commercial Corp., D2000-1232 (WIPO Dec. 7, 2000) (concluding that Respondent\u2019s [failure to make an active use] of the domain name satisfies the requirement of \u00b64(a)(iii) of the Policy); see also Clerical Med. Inv. Group Ltd. v. Clericalmedical.com, D2000-1228 (WIPO Nov. 28, 2000) (finding that merely holding an infringing domain name without active use can constitute use in bad faith).\nRespondent does not make active use of the domain names GREENHECKFAN.NET and GREENHECKVENTILATOR.NET. Rather, Respondent uses the domain names as parking pages that include links to competing websites. Respondent\u2019s non-use and extended failure to actively use the domain name by simply forwarding it to another website shows bad faith.\n  4.      Respondent Acted in Bad Faith when It Diverted Customers to Greenheck\u2019s Competitors.\n  Respondent\u2019s diversion of traffic to a competitor also shows bad faith pursuant to Policy \u00b64(b)(iii). David Hall Rare Coins v. Tex. Int\u2019l Prop. Assocs., FA 915206 (Forum Apr. 9, 2007) (finding that a respondent registered and used a disputed domain name in bad faith pursuant to Policy \u00b64(b)(iii) where that respondent used the domain name to advertise goods and services of a complainant\u2019s competitors, thereby disrupting that complainant\u2019s business); see also Puckett, Individually v. Miller, D2000-0297 (WIPO June 12, 2000) (finding that a respondent diverted business from a complainant to a competitor\u2019s website so as to come within the terms of Policy \u00b64(b)(iii)); Puckett, Individually v. Miller, D2000-0297 (WIPO June 12, 2000) (finding that Respondent has diverted business from Complainant to a competitor\u2019s website in violation of Policy \u00b64(b)(iii)).\nRespondent directly competed against Greenheck for consumers who were seeking to purchase air movement control products affiliated with the GREENHECK Marks. Both GREENHECK.NET and GREENHECKVENTILATOR.COM redirect to third party websites that sell competing products. Indeed, the GREENHECK.NET website further redirects to www.abbblower.com, which is a competing website owned by Respondent. The GREENHECK Domain Names each incorporate the GREENHECK mark in its entirety.  Respondent used that domain name to divert traffic to its website that should have reached Greenheck\u2019s websites. That is bad faith.\n5.      Respondent Acted in Bad Faith by Intentionally Attempting to Attract Internet Users to Its Website for Commercial Gain by Creating a Likelihood of Confusion with the GREENHECK Marks.\nBad faith intent pursuant to Policy \u00b64(b)(iv) is also shown from Respondent\u2019s choosing to use a designation that it knows to be similar to another\u2019s registered trademark in order to attract consumers to its website. See G.D. Searle & Co. v. Celebrex Drugstore, FA 123933 (Forum Nov. 21, 2002) (finding that Respondent registered and used the domain name in bad faith pursuant to Policy \u00b64(b)(iv) because Respondent was using the confusingly similar domain name to attract Internet users to its commercial website); AltaVista Co. v. Krotov, D2000-1091 (WIPO Oct. 25, 2000) (finding bad faith under Policy \u00b64(b)(iv) where Respondent\u2019s domain name resolved to a website that offered links to third-party websites that offered services similar to Complainant\u2019s services and merely took advantage of Internet user mistakes).\nBad faith is shown because Respondent registered the domain name in order to trade on Greenheck\u2019s goodwill associated with its GREENHECK Marks by creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the website. Here, Respondent used the GREENHECK Marks to attract consumers to its website. Respondent\u2019s use of Greenheck\u2019s GREENHECK Marks to attract consumers to its website who are searching for GREENHECK branded products demonstrates Respondent\u2019s bad faith.\n  B.

"America, United Kingdom, Macedonia, Madagascar, Peru, Poland, Syria, Taiwan etc. In India, the trade marks of the Complainant are registered under registration numbers 201233 in class 12, 225243 in class 07, 422777 in class 07 and 393803 in class 12.\nComplainant hosts and maintains a large number of web sites throughout the world, with domain names consisting of \u2018honda\u2019 and \u2018honda\u2019 in combination with various business related or geographic suffixes, including the domain name <hondacarindia.com>.\nRespondent has registered the domain name <hondaindia.com>.\n  5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\nThe domain name is identical to the trade mark of the Complainant. The word \u2018honda\u2019 forms an essential part of the domain name <hondaindia.com> of the Respondent. The said domain name is intended to project a message to the surfer/consumers that the Respondent is a subsidiary and/or associate company of the Complainant in India.\nThe Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name.\nThe Respondent has no trade mark rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name at issue due to the Complainant's long prior use of its mark. HONDA is not the legal name of the Respondent and the Respondent is not doing any business under that name. Moreover, the Respondent is based in America and appears to have no connection with India or business in India.\nHence, the use of the domain name <hondaindia.com> by the Respondent would invariably lead a surfer to believe that the said domain name belongs to the Complainant and represents the web site of the Complainant for the India region.\nThe domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith.\nThe Respondent has not established a web site accessible via the domain name <hondaindia.com>. The Respondent first registered the domain name in October, 1999. If the Respondent had a bona fide reason to register the said domain name, it would have proceeded to activate the web site at the said domain name address. The fact that the Respondent has chosen not to do so implies mala fide intentions on its behalf to sell the name to a third party or to use the said domain name for some fraudulent purpose.\nThe Respondent is deliberately and intentionally attempting to create a likelihood of confusion for the Internet users as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation and endorsement to get financial gains. The Respondent has also deliberately misappropriated and traded upon the Complainant's considerable goodwill and reputation. The Respondent appears to have made false representations to the Registrar that his registration of the domain name will not infringe or violate the trade mark rights of any third party. The Respondent has registered the domain name for sale or to prevent the Complainant reflecting its name in a corresponding domain name.\nThe domain name has been registered and used in bad faith. If the Respondent or any third party were to activate a web site via the said domain name, this would cause confusion among Internet users who would be misled into believing that there is some connection between the web site and the Complainant. It is submitted that the Respondent is preventing the Complainant from making legitimate use of its trademark on the Internet.\nB. Respondent\nThe Respondent registered the disputed domain name on October 5, 1999. This was nineteen days before the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (Policy) was approved by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN approved the policy on October 24, 1999.\nRespondent states that he has registered the domain name at issue for his future use. Respondent is planning to go back to India permanently in the year 2005, and start a non-profit charity organization with the sole purpose of helping the poor and neglected kids who are the future citizens of modern India by providing them with food, shelter and good education. Respondent\u2019s plans are to extend the charity work for helping battered women, helping the poor and neglected senior citizens, open hospitals for poor people etc.\nAccording to the Respondent, the word \"honda\" in the domain name <hondaindia>stands for:\nh- Humble\no- Organization for helping\nn- Neglected kids and\nd- Develop their\na- Abilities\nThe statement by the Complainant that Respondent\u2019s sole purpose in registering the domain name is to deceive the Honda Company is totally false. Since Respondent has registered the domain name with the sole purpose of using it in the future for his charity work, he is not currently using the web site.\nAll the statements by Honda Motor company in the Complaint, that Respondent is using the web site for gain, are false.\n  6. Discussion and Findings\nRespondent has asserted that his registration of the contested domain name took place before the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy was approved by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.\nPrevious decisions under the UDRP have decided that Respondents implicitly have consented to the UDRP through the renewal of domain name registrations. In the present case, the registrar Register.com has, through its Registrar Verification, also confirmed that the UDRP applies.\nA. Identical or Confusingly Similar\nThe addition of the name of a geographical suffix to a trademark, such as the addition of \"India\" to HONDA, is a common way of indicating subdivisions of global enterprises, or the geographical area that goods are offered under a trade mark. Complainant, itself, has evidenced that it uses the domain name <hondacarsindia.com> in connection with the offering of goods and services in India.\nComplainant\u2019s trade mark is famous around the globe. The addition of a geographical suffix, therefore, does not sufficiently alter the underlying mark to which it is added. A user of the Internet is, in the Panel\u2019s opinion, likely to assume that Complainant is the sponsor of, or is associated with, the web site identified by the disputed domain name with the addition of the geographical suffix \u2018india.\u2019 The elimination of the space between \"honda\" and a country name is dictated by technical factors and customary practice among domain name registrants, and is without legal significance from the standpoint of comparing Complainant\u2019s trademark and the contested domain name.\nHence, Complainant has met its burden of proving that the domain name at issue is confusingly similar to Complainant\u2019s trade mark, pursuant to the Policy, paragraph 4(a)(i).\nB. Rights or Legitimate Interests\nRespondent has furnished no evidence of use of the domain name at issue. Respondent has asserted an intent to establish a non-profit charity organization. Paragraph 4(c) of the Policy does not contemplate the attribution of rights based on the abbreviation of the name of a hypothetical future non-profit charity organization.\nRespondent has not used the name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services; has not been commonly known by the domain name, nor is it making legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the name.\nThe Panel, therefore, finds that Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the domain name at issue.\nC. Registered and Used in Bad Faith\nRespondent has not established a web site corresponding to the domain name at issue, the domain name is inactive. According to previous Panel decisions under the UDRP, this does not, however, necessarily prevent that the domain name has been registered and used in bad faith, see WIPO Case No. D2000-0003, Telstra Corporation v. Nuclear Marshmallows, where the Panel states with regard to non-use of the contested domain name:\n\"This fact does not, however, resolve the question. As discussed in paragraph 7.6, the relevant issue is not whether the Respondent is undertaking a positive action in bad faith in relation to the domain name, but instead whether, in all the circumstances of the case, it can be said that the Respondent is acting in bad faith. The distinction between undertaking a positive action in bad faith and acting in bad faith may seem a rather fine distinction, but it is an important one. The significance of the distinction is that the concept of a domain name \"being used in bad faith\" is not limited to positive action; inaction is within the concept. That is to say, it is possible, in certain circumstances, for inactivity by the Respondent to amount to the domain name being used in bad faith. \"\nHence, Respondent\u2019s passive holding of a domain name, without putting it to any use will have to be considered in conjunction with the other circumstances of the case. The question is whether an assessment of the totality of the case supports a finding of bad faith.\nPursuant to the Policy, paragraph 2, Respondent represents and warrants that his registration of the domain name will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party. Despite the above, Respondent has registered a domain name containing in its entirety the trademark HONDA, which, in the Panel\u2019s opinion, must have been known to Respondent due to its worldwide fame.\nBearing in mind that Respondent must have been aware of Complainant\u2019s trademark when deciding to register the disputed domain name, the Panel also find Respondent\u2019s explanation that HONDA is an acronym for \"Humble Organization for helping Neglected kids and Develop their Abilities\" unlikely. In the Panel\u2019s opinion, the explanation appears to be designed to circumvent the provisions of the Policy.\nIn its response, Respondent claims compensation for:\n\" the projected loss I am incurring (for shattering my hopes of owning this dream website (I had spent lot of time in coming up with this Acronym), spread the message of their cause and raise the money for helping those poor & neglected kids in India).\"\nIn light of the Panel\u2019s above findings, the Panel regards this as a circumstance that indicates that the domain name at issue was registered in an attempt to transfer the domain name registration to Complainant for valuable consideration in excess of Respondent\u2019s documented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain name, pursuant to the Policy, paragraph 4(b)(i).\nThe Panel therefore finds that Respondent has registered and used the domain name in bad faith.\n  7. Decision\nFor all the foregoing reasons, in accordance with Paragraphs 4(i) of the Policy and 15 of the Rules, the Panel orders that the domain name, <hondaindia.com>, be transferred to the Complainant.": [

"Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Kahaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al-Quwain. There are independent emirates such as Kuwait and Qatar. Accordingly the word \u201cEmirates\u201d does not connote a specific geographical location or the name of a place but is a description of a territory under the rule of an Emir.\n\nThe Complainant submits that the name and trademark EMIRATES is now a household name, exclusively associated with the Complainant by the general public. The term has a stronger significance as a trademark than as a geographical indicator or an abbreviation for United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe Complainant further contends that the respondent has acted in bad faith and does not have rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name.\n\nThe Complainant says that the disputed domain name was initially registered by RoosIT which, in a previous decision (Case No. 02955) was held to be closely related to, and to have the same signatory as, Stichting Roos Beheer. RoosIT made a successful Sunrise application to register the disputed domain name, based on a Maltese trademark for E&M&I&R&A&T&E&S. The Complainant submits that RoosIT did not intend to use that trademark for a bona fide offering of goods or services and that the application was made in bad faith.\n\nThe Complainant submits with documentary evidence that RoosIT made 214 similar trademark applications in Malta and 13 in the Benelux, such as F&1, V&I&R&G&I&N and O&2, which it submits were solely intended to allow RoosIT to register domain names such as f1.eu, virgin.eu and O2.eu, for itself or related entities. Furthermore the Maltese trademark registration specifies that \u201cregistration gives rights to the exclusive use of the word \u201cemirates\u201d, only when this is used within the \u201c&\u201d symbols as shown in the mark\u201d. RoosIT does not therefore hold any trademark or other rights in the word EMIRATES, only in the term E&M&I&R&A&T&E&S. The Complainant submits that it is inconceivable that there was any bona fide intention to use that trademark except to obtain the related .eu domain name.\n\nThe Complainant submits that RoosIT has shown a pattern of conduct in registering trademarks with the addition of \u201c&\u201d (ampersand) symbols and cites previous decisions in support (Case No. 04090 and Case No. 02955). Neither Stichting Roos Beheer, nor RoosIT before them, can demonstrate any rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name.\n\nIt is submitted that the disputed domain name cannot be used by the Respondent in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services. It could not have been chosen for any other reason than its association with the Complainant\u2019s trademark, of which RoosIT must have been aware. Where a mark is world famous, other traders would not choose it unless seeking to create an impression of association. Anyone selecting emirates.eu when searching for a website would believe they would be taken to the Complainant\u2019s webpage. Therefore RoosIT\u2019s choice to register the disputed domain name and Stichting Roos Beheer\u2019s subsequent ownership were motivated by the desire to divert users from the Complainant to the Respondent and therefore the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests.\n\nThe Complainant has cited previous domain name decisions that it would like to be treated as precedent.\n\nThe Complainant requests the transfer to it of the disputed domain name.\nB. Respondent\nThe Respondent denies the Complaint and makes contentions, with documentation submitted in support, that include the following.\n\nThe beneficial owner of the disputed domain name is Michael Toth of the United Kingdom. In the contentions that follow, Mr Toth speaks for the Respondent which he describes as a registrar or registration agency through which he registered the disputed domain name. Prior to the date of this Complaint Mr Toth was not aware that the disputed domain name remained in the name of Stichting Roos Beheer, instructions having been given for its transfer to Mr Toth (documentary evidence submitted). He says there is no evidence of a connection between Stichting Roos Beheer and RoosIT.\n\nIt is common ground that the word emirates can be a descriptive generic term. The Respondent denies the Complainant\u2019s assertion that the word does not connote a specific geographic location or place name. The Respondent draws comparisons with the website of emirates.org and invites perusal of the decision in WIPO Case No. DAU2008-0004 (emirates.com.au), which was decided against the Complainant, and by contrast, WIPO Case No. D2005-1311.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Complainant\u2019s relevant trademarks apply to its passenger air services under the name Emirates Airlines. The Complainant\u2019s freight service is operated as Emirates Sky Cargo, its tourism service is operated as Arabian Adventures, or as Emirates Holidays, and its aircraft engineering and maintenance service is operated as Emirates Engineering. Mr Toth does not seek to associate his business with any such services.\n\nTrademarks to which the Complainant refers consist of the word EMIRATES in combination with added matter. The Respondent submits registration documents of trademarks containing the word EMIRATES that do not belong to the Complainant and therefore show the Complainant not to have exclusive rights. An example is CTM 6549919 for THE NATIONAL AIRLINE OF THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES owned by Etihad Airways, which the Complainant has not opposed.\n\nMr Toth contends that he has not acted in bad faith and does have a legitimate interest in the disputed domain name. His websites contain information of interest and are funded by advertising revenue or commissions, which is an accepted method of business.\n\nThe Respondent says that the Complainant has acknowledged that the word emirates is a geographic description. Mr Toth says he is also the registrant of the domain name emirates.co.uk which, together with the disputed domain name and according to the evidence, points to an information portal website entitled \u201cThe United Arab Emirates Resource Guide\u201d that contains useful information. It is submitted that the care and skill in the construction of that home page compare very favourably with www.emirates.org.\n\nMr Toth says his website is carefully constructed and not the usual \u201cparking\u201d page. It includes a car hire search engine and his business receives a commission for each booking. Mr Toth thereby claims a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 21(1)(a) and Art. 21(2)(a) of Regulation EC 874/2004. The disputed domain name points to an information portal about the UAE from which Mr Toth generates legitimate income in a manner that does not impinge upon any rights the Complainant may have in the word emirates. Mr Toth says he uses the same short form of United Arab Emirates as does the official web site of the UAE, namely the simple word emirates as part of the disputed domain name.\n\nIf the Complainant seeks to suggest that Mr Toth should have used either unitedarabemirates.eu or unitedarabemirates.co.uk for his business, in fact neither is available, and in any case, Mr Toth wants to be inclusive of independent emirates.\n\nMr Toth submits a list of about 212 domain names owned by him based on country names (including emirates.co.uk and emirates.ltd.uk, but excluding emirates.eu). These have been registered to promote his similar business within the countries concerned.\n\nMr Toth says that the disputed domain name has been registered since September 2006 and points to a website corresponding to emirates.co.uk, registered in April 2002, which has been live since December 2004. Documents show that a demand from the Complainant in April 2008 for the transfer of emirates.co.uk received a robust reply and the matter did not proceed. As an unsolicited gesture of goodwill Mr Toth added a link to the Complainant\u2019s website.\n\nMr Toth says that a list of trademark applications (by RoosIT) submitted by the Complainant relates to common descriptive words that would be devoid of distinctive character but for the alternating ampersands. There is no evidence that the registrant of these trademarks attempted to misappropriate the registered trademark of any third party. It cannot be said that seeking trademark registration for a descriptive word, disguised and rendered distinctive with ampersand symbols, constitutes bad faith.\n\nThe validity or otherwise of those other trademarks is not open to question in this proceeding. It is not necessary to consider whether the applicant intended to use the trademark concerned, or whether intention to use is required under trademark law of Malta or Benelux. It has been accepted (e.g., Case No. 01867, domain name OXFORD) that a trademark incorporating the \u201c&\u201d symbol constitutes a Prior Right for the purposes of Art. 10(1) of the regulation. In consequence the presently relevant trademark relied upon by its registrant in the Sunrise period is a valid Prior Right. The Complainant could have brought a complaint against EURid at the appropriate time. There is no evidence to show that the Complainant was blocked by the disputed domain name from filing an application under the Sunrise regulations or that the Complainant was in a position to do so. The Complainant\u2019s stance may be equated with reverse domain name hijacking.\n\nThe relevance (if any) of Case No. 04090 and Case No. 02955 cited by the Complainant appears to be that the relevant respondent in those cases failed to show a legitimate interest, whereas in the present case Mr Toth does have a legitimate interest.\n\nThe Complainant alleges that \u201canyone typing Emirates.eu when searching for a website would believe that they would be taken to the Complainant\u2019s webpage\u201d. The Respondent says there is no evidence that this is so. Numerous other traders have established trademark rights in the word emirates so there may be many reasons why people search for the word.\nDiscussion and Findings\nGiven the convoluted contentions in this dispute, the Panel will set out certain findings of fact before analysis of the Rules.\n\nRoosIT, which is not a Party to this dispute, appears to be domiciled in the Netherlands and to have registered over 200 Maltese trademarks, in blocks of consecutive registration numbers. They are of the general form M&A&P&S, that is to say, the word MAPS with ampersands between the letters. The list includes many possibly uncontentious words such as MUSIC, MOVIES, RADIO, TICKETS, BEACH ..., but in each case with ampersands between the letters.\n\nTrademarks such as M&A&P&S might appear to be of limited use but their purpose to RoosIT evidently was to lay claim to related .eu domain names at the opening, on the basis of a prior right in a trademark. Domain names cannot contain ampersands, therefore the domain name MAPS could be claimed to be closely related to the trademark M&A&P&S.\n\nAs pointed out by the Complainant, the learned Panelist in Formula One Licensing BV v RoosIT, Marc Roos, Case No. 02955, found reason to refer to the present Respondent in these terms: \u201c... Stichting Roos Beheer, a company which appears to be related and whose signatory appears to be the same Mark [sic] Roos as signed the transfer on behalf of the Respondent\u201d. That dispute concerned the Maltese trademark F&1 on the basis of which the relevant Respondent (named as RoosIT, Marc Roos) obtained the domain name f1.eu. The decision referred in its course to RoosIT, Marc Roos, having registered 214 Maltese ampersand-rich trademarks and subsequently a number of related .eu domain names.\n\nThe Respondent says there is no evidence to connect Stichting Roos Beheer with RoosIT. Either way, Stichting Roos Beheer is the recorded holder of the presently disputed domain name. ADR Rules A1 defines a Respondent as \u201cthe holder of a .eu domain name registration ... in respect of which a Complaint ... is initiated\u201d. The Respondent is therefore the registrant Stichting Roos Beheer.\n\nWith the evident acquiescence of the Respondent, Mr Michael Toth answers for it in this dispute. According to Mr Toth\u2019s evidence he is the beneficial owner of the disputed domain name, he thought it had been transferred to him, and expects that it will be. It is clear that he has control over it. It will be convenient to refer to the Respondent, or Stichting Roos Beheer, or Mr Toth, interchangeably.\n\nMr Toth expressly states his business model. He operates websites upon the principle known as click-through or pay-per-click. Websites display links to advertisers, and when a viewer follows such a link, the destination site pays a commission to Mr Toth. He may also exhibit paid advertisements. Thus his websites generate income.\n\nIn general the click-through business model may be entirely legitimate. Many websites providing information such as news or data as a public service are legitimately subsidized by click-through or paid advertisements. The model is capable of sophistication as the operator may subscribe to a service that targets advertisements and links according to what is known about each visitor and their search, or the operator can incorporate functionality such as an off-the-shelf search engine or car-rental search facility.\n\nThe business can be magnified by owning multiple domain names. Mr Toth provides a list of over 200 domain names he owns based on country names (americansamoa.org.uk, andorra.me.uk, anguilla.me.uk ...). It may be that many of these are free to use.\n\nThe name EMIRATES requires deeper enquiry. On the one hand it may be partially in the nature of a geographic identifier. These are notoriously difficult to trademark standing alone; see, for example, Her Majesty The Queen, in right of her Government in New Zealand, as Trustee for the Citizens, Organizations and State of New Zealand, acting by and through the Honourable Jim Sutton, the Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade v Virtual Countries, Inc., WIPO Case No. D2002-0754, which was decided against the relevant Complainant by a Panel of three. Even if a place name is trademarked, the registration may be restricted or placed on a supplementary register as a matter of record but with little or no protection.\n\nOn the other hand the word emirate is generic, meaning a nation with an Emir. Generic words standing alone cannot normally be trademarked in the same generic field but may be in another. Thus Apple or Blackberry standing alone can be trademarked in respect of computers or telephones, but not for fruit.\n\nOn the balance, the Panel finds the word emirates, standing alone and detached from the immediate context of any particular emirate or the United Arab Emirates, to be more a generic word than a place name. Furthermore, it is outside of its generic field that the word emirates has become the name of a major international airline. In other words, in the present context, reference to EMIRATES standing alone would likely evoke a particular airline and seldom a place or number of places. Inescapably, the name EMIRATES has been accepted for registration as a trademark in the European Community and in the UK. The Complainant owns the trademark and the Respondent does not.\n\nThe Panel now turns to the matters that the Complainant is required to prove on the balance of probabilities in accordance with ADR Rules B11(d)(1). The citations indicated by both Parties have been consulted, taking into account differences between the Rules and the UDRP.\n\nWHETHER THE DOMAIN NAME IS CONFUSINGLY SIMILAR TO A NAME IN WHICH THE COMPLAINANT HAS RIGHTS\n\nThe registration of UK trademark 2023709 displays the word EMIRATES below an Arabic character that, according to the document, reads as Al-Imarat, meaning The Emirates. The trademark was registered by the Complainant on March 22, 1996 in Class 39. The equivalent trademark was registered by the Complainant": [

"Schweizerischen Privatrecht, Helbing & Lichtenhahn, Basel 2008, N 1 ad Art. 956 OR).\nZu Recht erw\u00e4hnt der Gesuchsteller also nur den Schutz des Namensrechts gem\u00e4ss Art. 29 ZGB. Voraussetzung einer unbefugten Namensanmassung ist gem\u00e4ss Bundesgericht, dass rechtlich sch\u00fctzenswerte Interessen des betroffenen Namenstr\u00e4gers beeintr\u00e4chtigt werden, was eine Verwechslungsgefahr erfordert. Eine vollst\u00e4ndige \u00dcbereinstimmung der Namen ist dazu zwar nicht vorausgesetzt; die Anmassung eines Namens ist auch im Verwenden \u00e4hnlicher Zeichen m\u00f6glich (BGE 116 II 469).\nBeim Namen des Gesuchstellers steht aber der Ausdruck \u201eGesch\u00e4ftsmieter\u201c nicht alleine. Die Ausdr\u00fccke \u201cVerband\u201d und \u201eder\u201c sind auch Teile des Namens. Insbesondere das Wort \u201eVerband\u201c ist wichtig, da es die juristische Struktur des Gesuchstellers darstellt, was eine wesentliche Information f\u00fcr Dritte darstellt. Der Begriff \u201cGesch\u00e4ftsmieter\u201d stellt \u00fcberdies eine beschreibende Bezeichnung f\u00fcr die Aktivit\u00e4ten des Gesuchstellers dar. Damit ist an sich bereits erstellt, dass der Gesuchsteller an dieser Bezeichnung kein absolutes Namensrecht geltend machen kann und dass damit auch keine offensichtliche Verwechslungsgefahr zwischen dem Namen des Gesuchstellers und dem streitigen Domain-Namen besteht. Der Gesuchsteller hat auch nicht dargelegt, wie der Begriff \u201cGesch\u00e4ftsmieter\u201d als durchgesetzte Bezeichnung zu betrachten ist. Ohne einen rechtserzeugenden Namensgebrauch kann der Gesuchsteller f\u00fcr die von Haus aus nicht gesch\u00fctzte Bezeichnung \u201cGesch\u00e4ftsmieter\u201d f\u00fcr sich kein absolutes Recht herleiten (vgl. dazu B\u00fchler, Basler Kommentar, Art. 29 ZGB N. 16).\nVor diesem Hintergrund beh\u00e4lt im vorliegenden Verfahren das Priorit\u00e4tsprinzip seine Geltung. Der Gesuchgegner hat den streitigen Domain-Namen zuerst registriert und ist demzufolge, nach Ansicht des Experten und hinsichtlich der Umst\u00e4nde in diesem Verfahren, in seiner Rechtsposition zu sch\u00fctzen. Dieser Schluss stimmt im Ergebnis auch mit dem wegweisenden Entscheid BGE 126 III 239 \u00fcberein. Darin hat das Bundesgericht festgehalten, dass ein Erstanmelder eines Domain-Namens bez\u00fcglich eines freihaltebed\u00fcrftigen (geographischen) Namens nur dann nicht in den Genuss des Priorit\u00e4tsprinzips kommen soll, wenn eine gemeinfreie Bezeichnung durch langen Gebrauch zum Individualzeichen geworden ist und eine Verwechslungsgefahr geschaffen wird, welcher nicht mit geeigneten Zus\u00e4tzen oder auf andere Weise begegnet werden k\u00f6nne ( WIPO Verfahren Nr. DCH2004-0016, Tourismusverein Lenzerheide-Valbella v. Max B\u00e4r Ferienwohnungsvermietung; WIPO Verfahren Nr. DCH2004-0023, Silvio Dudli v. Seelitho AG). Diese beiden Voraussetzungen sind im vorliegenden Fall, wie ausgef\u00fchrt wurde, nicht erf\u00fcllt.\nB. Liegt eine Verletzung des UWG vor?": [

Het verwarringsgevaar wordt voort nog versterkt, aldus Eiseres, doordat de naam KUKA een sterke reputatie heeft in Nederland door het hoge marktaandeel van Eiseres. Internetgebruikers die de Domeinnaam zullen bezoeken zullen informatie van Eiseres verwachten. Doordat de Domeinnaam wordt misbruikt zal dit niet het geval zijn. Vele internetgebruikers worden hierdoor misleid.\nDomeinnaamhouder heeft geen recht of legitiem belang bij de Domeinnaam\nEiseres stelt dat partijen al een lange zakelijke relatie met elkaar hebben. In 1985 is KUKA AG tot de Nederlandse markt toegetreden. In die tijd was KUKA AG betrokken bij een project voor Nedcar in Nederland.\nEiseres en Verweerster hebben in diverse projecten samengewerkt. Ook werd er personeel over en weer uitgeleend en werden door Verweerster KUKA-producten verkocht. Volgens Eiseres wilde Verweerster van meet af bekend staan als de offici\u00eble vertegenwoordigster van KUKA AG in Nederland. Dit zijn Eiseres en Verweerster echter niet overeengekomen.

Further, as per the Registrar\u2019s register, the Respondent is an individual.\nRespondent\u2019s Trading Name and Trademarks\n4.10 The Respondent is non-trading, non-commercial entity. The response does not disclose any trading name and trademark possessed by the respondent nor any information as to the activities of the Respondent is asserted in the Response except that he has vast knowledge of household and consumer goods.\nRespondent\u2019s Domain Names and Web Sites\n4.11 The response discloses that the Respondent owns only the disputed web site, namely, <skfindia.com>.\n  5. Relevant Provisions of the Uniform Policy\n5.1 Paragraph 4(a) of the Uniform Policy sets out the three requirements which must be present for a proceeding to be brought against the Respondent under the Uniform Policy, and which the Complainant must prove in order to be able to obtain a remedy. It is as follows:\na. Applicable Disputes\nYou are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in the event that a third party (a \"complainant\") asserts to the applicable Provider, in compliance with the Rules of Procedure, that\n(i) your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and\n(ii) you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and\n(iii) your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\nIn the administrative proceeding, the complainant must prove that each of these three elements are present.\n5.2 Paragraph 4(b) of the Uniform Policy identifies, in particular but without limitation, four circumstances which, if found by the Administrative Panel to be present, shall be evidence of the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith. The precise wording of this paragraph is as follows:\nb. Evidence of Registration and Use in Bad Faith.\nFor the purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(iii), the following circumstances, in particular but without limitation, if found by the Panel to be present, shall be evidence of the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith:\n(i) circumstances indicating that you have registered or you have acquired the domain name primarily for the purposes of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration in excess of your documented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain name; or\n(ii) you have registered the domain name in order to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, provided that you have engaged in a pattern of such conduct; or\n(iii) you have registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or\n(iv) by using the domain name, you have intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, internet users to your web site or other on line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant\u2019s mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of your web site or location or of a product or service on your web site or location.\n5.3 It may be mentioned that circumstances specified in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), and (iii) of paragraph 4(a) deal with the intention or purpose of domain name registration, the four circumstances in paragraph 4(b) are illustrative and the existence of any of them, will be an instance of \"registration of a domain name in bad faith\".\n5.4 Paragraph 4(c) of the Uniform Policy sets out circumstances, in particular but without limitation, which, if found by the Administrative Panel to be proved, demonstrate the Respondent\u2019s rights or legitimate interests to the domain name for the purposes of paragraph 4(a)(ii). The provisions of this paragraph are as follows:\nc. How to Demonstrate Your Rights to and Legitimate Interests in the Domain Name in Responding to a Complaint.\nWhen you receive a complaint, you should refer to Paragraph 5 of the Rules of Procedure in determining how your response should be prepared. Any of the following circumstances, In particular but without limitation, if found by the Panel to be proved based on its evaluation of all evidence presented, shall demonstrate your rights or legitimate interests to the domain name for purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(ii):\n(i) before any notice to you of the dispute, your use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services; or\n(ii) you (as an individual, business, or other organization) have been commonly known by the domain name, even if you have acquired no trademark or service mark rights; or\n(iii) you are making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name, without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue.\n  6. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nThe Complaint\n6.1 The Complainants contend that each of the three elements specified in paragraph 4(a) of the Uniform Policy are applicable to this dispute. In relation to element (i), the Complainants contend that the trademark \"SKF\" contained in the domain name <skfindia.com> registered by the Respondent incorporates the entire trademark of the Complainant and hence it is confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademark. The addenda \"india\" in the domain name does not prevent the domain name from being confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademark. A suffix like \"india\" is generic and does not effectively distinguish the Respondent\u2019s domain name. In support of this contention, the Complainants have relied on Viacom International Inc. v. Sung Wook Choi and M Production, (WIPO Case No. D2000-1114) wherein the Administrative Panel has observed that, \"This is consistent with this and other Panels earlier decisions that common geographic qualifiers can rarely be relied upon to differentiate if the other elements of the domain name comprise a mark or marks in which another party has rights.\" Thus, the domain name <skfindia.com > is identical or confusingly similar to the trademark of the Complainants.\n6.2 In relation to element (ii), the Complainants contend that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interest in the domain name <skfindia.com>. The Respondent is not commonly known by the name <SKF>. The Complainants further contend that the Complainants have not authorized the Respondent to use their trademark <SKF>. Further, the Respondent has not made any demonstrable preparations to use the impugned domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods/services. The Complainants further contend that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name in issue. The sole purpose of the registration is to misappropriate the reputation associated with the Complainant\u2019s trade mark <SKF>. As on the date of filing the complaint, the web site was inactive.\n6.3 Regarding the element at (iii), the Complainants contend that :\n(a) The impugned domain name belonged to the Complainants till September 23, 2000. Owing to the inadvertence of Complainant No. 2 in paying the renewal fees, the registration of the domain name in the name of the Complainant lapsed and the respondent immediately registered the domain name. According to an e mail received by the Complainants, the sole purpose of the respondent\u2019s registration of this domain name was to sell it to the Complainants for valuable consideration in excess of the respondent\u2019s out of pocket costs directly related to the domain name. This amounts to bad faith as er para 4(b)(i) of the Policy.\n(b) the Respondent, being an Indian, clearly knew of the Complainants\u2019 trademark rights and its extensive business presence in India. This by itself suggests that the registration has been in bad faith. In support of this contention, the Complainants have annexed a copy of an affidavit of an employee filed in the court, wherein the employee has stated that he received a telephone call from the Respondent. The Respondent said that he was troubled because a lot of people were confusing the web site he had registered as that of the Complainant. In support of this contention, the Complainants have relied on the Administrative Panel\u2019s decision in Cellular One Group v. Paul Brein (WIPO Case No. D2000-0028).(A copy of the decision is available at Annexure I). Further that the customers of the Complainants are likely to believe that the complainant has licensed its trademark SKF to the Respondent or authorized the Respondent to register the impugned domain name or that the Respondent has some connection with the Complainant in terms of direct nexus or affiliation with the SKF Group.\n(c) the impugned domain name <skfindia.com> was registered by the Respondent on": [

It is also a shop window for promoting the Michelin goods and services by presenting a selection of information in connection with the destinations, or with its tourism guides, as well as tires. Viamichelin Company is also a subsidiary of the Michelin Group dedicated to travel assistance services using digital media and is a complementary product to the famous MICHELIN Guides.\nFor commercial consistency, the Complainants registered several domain names corresponding to the trademarks MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH and operate websites promoting their companies and products at: \u201cwww.michelin.com\u201d; \u201cwww.viamichelin.com\u201d; \u201cmichelinman.com\u201d; \u201cwww.michelinsport.com\u201d; \u201cwww.bfgoodrichtires.com\u201d; \u201cwww. and bfgoodrich.com\u201d.\nAs soon as the Complainants and the Michelin Group became aware of the existence of the Domain Names in issue, they sent cease and desist letters by e-mail and certified mail with return receipt to the Respondent on August 6 and 18, 2004, to inform him of their rights and their infringement through the registration and the use of the Domain Names in issue.\nThe Respondent having failed to respond to these letters, the Complainants sent another cease and desist letter to the Respondent, to which they again received no reply.\n  5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\n1. The domain names are identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the Complainants have rights:\n(Policy, paragraph 4(a)(i), Rules, paragraphs 3(b)(viii), (b)(ix)(1))\n1.1. The following Domain Names:\n<ciamichelin>\n<giamichelin>\n<iamichelin>\n<voamichelin>\n<vioamichelin>\n<vaimichelin>\n<vamichelin>\n<www-viamichelin.com>\nare formed of the trademark MICHELIN to which 2, 3 or 4 letters have been added. In these Domain Names, the word \u201cmichelin\u201d is without doubt the predominant element. From a visual and phonetical point of view, these Domain Names are similar to the trademark MICHELIN. The addition of the elements \u201ccia\u201d, \u201cia\u201d, \u201cvoa\u201d, \u201cgia\u201d, \u201cvioa\u201d, \u201cvai\u201d, \u201cva\u201d or \u201cwww-\u201d before the Complainant\u2019s mark is not sufficient to distinguish the domain names from Complainant\u2019s trademark. On the contrary, these additions are designed to take advantage of mistakes that consumers are likely to make when trying to type the Complaint\u2019s website address. Therefore, Complainant contends the above Domain Names are confusingly similar to the trademark MICHELIN in which the Complainant has rights.\nFurthermore, it should be added that Michelin has become well known for its guides and maps and has developed on the Internet a website aiming at assisting people on line with itineraries. The said website, registered on November 7, 2000, is \u201cviamichelin.com\u201d and is used in the manner of a trademark. It clearly appears that the Respondent has imitated this unregistered trademark VIAMICHELIN as it has chosen domain names presenting misspelling of \u201cviamichelin\u201d: <ciamichelin.com>, <giamichelin.com>, <iamichelin.com>, <voamichelin.com>, <vioamichelin.com>, <vaimichelin.com>, <vamichelin.com> and <www-viamichelin.com>. The Domain Names are, therefore, similar to the trademark MICHELIN and the brand name VIAMICHELIN.\n1.2. The Domain Name <michelinmen.com> is formed of the trademark MICHELIN to which a three-letter generic word \u201cmen\u201d has been affixed.\nFrom a visual and phonetical point of view, this Domain Name is similar to the trademark MICHELIN, as it clearly shows some resemblance with the notorious registered MICHELIN trademark which represents the distinctive and predominant element within the Domain Name. The well-known trademark MICHELIN is placed at the beginning of the Domain Name, which enables Internet users to immediately acknowledge and memorize this Internet address. The addition of the word \u201cmen\u201d is not sufficient to distinguish the Domain Name <michelinmen.com> from Complainant\u2019s MICHELIN trademark and avoid confusion.\nBesides, the Domain Name evokes what has been for decades the well-known symbol of the Michelin group, namely the \u201cMichelin Man\u201d, also called BIBENDUM in French. This character, which has been considered the most famous device of the last century, is not only commonly known by consumers of MICHELIN products and services but also by the general public, due to its kindly appearance, its smile and its body originally made of tires. Visually, this drawing immediately refers to Michelin in the mind of the public, insofar as the company has been affixing it on its goods and services (tires, maps, guides, electronic maps on Internet) since the beginning of its business. The public has become so familiar with this drawing that it has even been named in the English language as the \u201cMichelin Man\u201d.\nInsofar as \u201cMichelin Man\u201d has become a keyword to designate the Michelin Group, the Complainant has registered a domain name <michelinman.com> which directs to a website dedicated to it.\nIt is obvious that the English plural \u201cmen\u201d is used by the Respondent in its domain name <michelinmen.com> to take advantage of the misspelling of the denomination \u201cMICHELIN MAN\u201d and the corresponding domain name <michelinman.com> by the public.\nWhether the Panel considers that there is a difference between the trademark MICHELIN and the domain name <michelinmen.com>, at least it must be regarded as a minor difference, which is legally and practically insignificant.\nTherefore, it must be concluded that the domain name <michelinmen.com> is identical or at least confusingly similar to the trademark MICHELIN in which the Complainant has rights.\n1.3. The Domain Name <michelinsports.com>\nThe disputed domain name is formed of the trademark MICHELIN to which a generic word \u201csport\u201d has been affixed.\nFrom a visual and phonetical point of view, this Domain Name is similar to the trademark MICHELIN, as it clearly shows some resemblance with the notorious MICHELIN trademark, which represents the distinctive and predominant element within the Domain Name.\nThe well-known trademark MICHELIN is placed at the beginning of the Domain Name, which enables Internet users to immediately acknowledge and memorize this Internet address. The addition of the word \u201csports\u201d is not sufficient to distinguish the Domain Name <michelinsports.com> from Complainant\u2019s MICHELIN trademark and avoid confusion.\nThe Domain Name integrates the trademark in its entirety, as the trademark MICHELIN does not lose its individual character in the sign.\nMore specifically, the Internet user would undoubtedly be confused into believing that the domain name <michelinsports.com> is the sport branch of MICHELIN, a website dedicated to races, competition, sportscars. In fact, the contested domain name differs by one letter only to Complainant\u2019s own website \u201cwww.michelinsport.com\u201d which was registered on August 2, 1999. In conclusionthe Domain Name <michelinsports.com> is confusingly similar to the trademark MICHELIN in which the Complainant has rights.\n2. The following Domain Names:\n<bfgodrich.com>\n<wwwbfgoodrichtires.com>\n<bfgodrichtires.com>\nshow some resemblance with the registered trademark BFGOODRICH which may confuse the public.\nWithin the Domain Names, the Internet user will recognize BFGOODRICH as the predominant element, due to its length, its notoriety and individual character.\n2.1. <bfgodrich.com>\nThe fact that the Respondent has erased only one letter in a total of 10 letters of the trademark is not sufficient to consider that the difference is predominant.\nMore specifically, it must be emphasised that the Respondent has chosen to cancel the vowel \u201cO\u201d which is originally doubled in the trademark BFGOODRICH. This modification is so weak that it is visually and phonetically difficult for the Internet user to notice it.\nIt is hard to believe that this only modification occurred by chance. It is likely that the Respondent tried to take advantage of the Internet user\u2019s misspelling while typing the Internet address of a website.\nTherefore, it must be concluded that the Domain Name <bfgodrich.com> is confusingly similar to the trademark BFGOODRICH in which the Complainant has rights.\n2.2. <wwwbfgoodrichtires.com>\nThe Respondent has reproduced the trademark BFGOODRICH in its entirety, to which it has simply added the usual Internet designation \u201cwww\u201d and the generic term \u201ctires\u201d designating the goods the trademark BFGOODRICH covers.\nThe set of initials \u201cwww\u201d is a technical requirement while entering the Internet address on the webpage. It happens that Internet user forgets to separate by a dot the initials \u201cwww\u201d from the intended domain name.\nThe implication of this misspelling is that the Internet user is not connected to the intended website or, as in the present issue, is directed to another website, which is confusing.\nMoreover, the trademark BFGOODRICH does not lose its individual character within the domain name <wwwbfgoodrichtires.com>.\nBesides, the Respondent may not reasonably assert that the addition of the generic word \u201ctires\u201d is sufficient to distinguish the signs in issue as the addition of this term does not avoid confusion.\nIndeed, this behaviour is a way to take advantage of the consumers\u2019 misspelling.\nIt is worth underlining that the corresponding website of the Complainant is \u201cwww.bfgoodrichtires.com\u201d.\nTherefore, it must be concluded that both domain names <bfgodrich.com> and <wwwbfgoodrichtires.com> are confusingly similar to the trademark BFGOODRICH in which the Complainant has rights.\n2.3. <bfgodrichtires.com>\nIn addition to the voluntary misspelling of the trademark BFGOODRICH (see above), the Respondent has added the generic term \u201ctires\u201d in respect of the goods that that trademark designates.\nHowever, the Respondent may not assert that the addition of the word \u201ctires\u201d is sufficient to distinguish the signs in issue and to avoid confusion.\nThe Domain Name <bfgodrichtires.com> is, therefore, confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademark.\n2. The Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain names (Policy, paragraphs 4(a)(ii), Rules, paragraph 3(b)(ix)(2))\nComplainant asserts that the Respondent is necessarily aware of the existing trademarks MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH due to their notoriety but also to the letters notifying him of Michelin\u2019s rights in the same trademarks.\nEvidently, the registered cease and desist letters that the Complainant has addressed to him are a supplementary proof that the Respondent cannot ignore the famous trademark MICHELIN.\nHowever, the Respondent did not provide any explanation nor evidence of any legitimate right or interest in the Domain Names. Moreover, the Respondent must have had knowledge of the existence of the MICHELIN trademark when he registered the Domain Names as it is registered since 1974 in Respondent\u2019s own country.\nThe Respondent is using the Domain Names without any authorization or license from the Complainants.\nIn addition to that, it appears that the Respondent has not registered nor used the name MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH as trademarks or trade names, nor has he ever been known by these names.\nThe adoption by the Respondent of Internet addresses similar to the trademarks MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH, the commercial name MICHELIN, the domain names \u201cMichelin\u201d and \u201cbfgoodrich\u201d of the Complainants would inevitably and misleadingly divert consumers to its websites and have the effect of tarnishing the trademarks.\nThe Respondent may not justify of any rights or legitimate interest in the present domain names, whereas the Complainants have duly mentioned to the Respondent that they were the owners of the trademarks MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH.\nIn view of the above, it is demonstrated that the Respondent has no rights nor legitimate interests in relation to the Domain Names.\n3. The domain names were registered and are being used in bad faith (Policy, paragraphs 4(a)(iii), 4(b); Rules, paragraph 3(b)(ix)(3))\nDespite several letters informing the Respondent about the Complainants\u2019 trademark rights, no explanation regarding the registration and the use of the Domain Names in issue has been provided by the Respondent.\n1. Registration in bad faith\nThe Respondent has registered thirteen domain names using the Complainants\u2019 well-known marks some of which he used to direct Internet users to other websites.\nAt this time, the prior trademarks MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH were registered in a large number of countries, including South America. Both the trademark MICHELIN and also the name of the character \u201cMICHELIN MAN\u201d were registered and have been widely used also in South America.\nFor that reason, the Respondent may not allege that it could not have any knowledge of any foreign trademarks MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH insofar as they are duly registered not only in Uruguay, where the Respondent is located, but also in the bordering States (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Paraguay).\nAlthough the existence of a trademark protection within the country of origin of the respondent is not a requirement to characterize cybersquatting under the UDRP, it should be considered as a material demonstration of bad faith in the registration of a domain name.\nAnd the notoriety acquired by Michelin for the trademarks MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH is supplementary evidence of bad faith.\nIt is underlined that there is a well-established principle under UDRP case law and under paragraph 2 of the Policy, stating that, when someone registers a domain name, he represents and warrants to the registrar that, to his knowledge, the registration of the domain name will not infringe the rights of any third party.\nHowever, due to the similarities between the trademarks MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH with the Domain Names in issue, it is more than probable that the Respondent had the Complainants\u2019 trademarks MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH in mind when registering the Domain Names, especially as the Complainants\u2019 trademarks are well known.\nTheoretically, the Respondent should have previously checked the availability of the Domain Names before registering them.\nIn any event, the Respondent could not ignore the existence of prior rights on MICHELIN, BFGOODRICH, VIAMICHELIN and the prior use of the well-known name \u201cMICHELIN MAN\u201d, as trademarks, trade name, commercial name, domain name.\nAs a matter of fact, even if the Respondent did not conduct clearance searches within the Trademark Register, the prior trademarks MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH and also the name of the Michelin character do benefit from a very high notoriety around the world.\nThe fact that the Complainant\u2019s entire trademarks MICHELIN and BFGOODRICH are registered as part of the respective domain names (<www-viamichelin.com>, <voamichelin.com>, <vamichelin.com>, <vaimichelin.com>, <iamichelin.com>, <giamichelin.com>, <ciamichelin.com>, <vioamichelin.com>, <michelinmen.com>, <michelinsports.com>, <bfgodrich.com>, <wwwbfgoodrichtires.com> and <bfgodrichtires.com>) renders difficult to infer a legitimate use of the domain names by Respondent.\nNo explanation may be reasonably submitted to understand why the Respondent selected the said domain names other than to mislead Internet users and create a likelihood of confusion with the Complainants.\nAnd it must be underlined that Michelin has owned the domain name <michelinman.com>, corresponding to the Michelin character, namely the singular version of \u201cmichelinmen\u201d, since November 6, 2001, and also <viamichelin.com>, the singular version <michelinsport.com>, and <bfgoodrichtires.com> without misspelling.\nIt seems that the Respondent considered that the few letters difference between the signs in issue would be sufficient to avoid any claims from the Complainants.\nFor all those reasons, it appears that the Respondent has conscientiously tried to take advantage of the Internet users\u2019 misspelling in the Internet address.\nThe Internet users who would use a search engine to locate the Complainants\u2019 websites are likely to be led to Respondent\u2019s one due to the similarities of the domain names.\nTherefore, in view of the above, it must be sustained that the domain names are registered in bad faith.\nIt has to be emphasized that the Respondent has voluntarily ignored the content of the cease and desist letter as he has registered some domain names in December 2004 infringing Michelin rights.\nThis behaviour reinforces his bad faith as he could not ignore Michelin rights at the time of the registration.\nThe fact that the Respondent has intentionally registered many websites with misspellings on VIAMICHELIN, MICHELIN, MICHELINMAN or BFGOODRICH is typosquatting: the Respondent imitates the trademarks MICHELIN, BFGOODRICH and the brand name VIAMICHELIN by registering domain names whose similarities consist in the misspelling of the original trademarks and/or brand name.\nThis typosquatting is a specific form of cybersquatting and clearly shows the bad faith of the Respondent.\n2. Use in bad faith\nSome of the Domain Names in issue, namely, <www-viamichelin.com>, <voamichelin.com>, <vamichelin.com>, <vaimichelin.com> are linked to a general portal website and some others namely, <iamichelin.com>, <giamichelin.com>, <ciamichelin.com>, <vioamichelin.com>, <michelinmen.com>, <bfgodrich.com>, <bfgodrichtires.com> and <wwwbfgoodrichtires.com>, direct the Internet user to websites with a portal where a board mainly shows several car and car parts brands mixed with generic terms: MICHELIN tires or BF GOODRICH tires, Automobiles tires, Auto parts, BMW parts, Volvo parts, Toyota parts, Bridgestone tires\u2026\nIt must be underlined that the top trademarks, which appear in the sites are MICHELIN tires or BF GOODRICH tires.\nThere is no indication that these websites are not supported by the trademark owners or that they are not official websites, which may confuse the Internet users who look for official information about the trademarks and the goods they designate.\nInsofar as these websites are mainly linked with car parts and car parts brands, the Respondent\u2019s behaviour demonstrates his bad faith in the use of the highly similar trademarks. He could hardly pretend that he ignored the trademarks MICHELIN and BF GOODRICH insofar as he uses his Domain Names in connection with tires, goods in relation to which MICHELIN and BF GOODRICH have acquired notoriety.\nBy virtue of Paragraph 4 (b) of the Policy, it must be evidenced, in particular: \u201cWhether by using the domain name, the Respondent intentionally attempted to attract for commercial gain, Internet users to the Respondent\u2019s web site or other on-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the Complainant\u2019s mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the Respondent\u2019s web site or location or of a product or service on the Respondent\u2019s web site or location.\u201d\nThe reproduction of the portal shows that the Respondent mixes on the same board several brands, which may confuse the public who would conclude that there is a venture between the car and car parts and accessories companies.\nObviously, the aim of an Internet portal is to collect, organise and select keywords to direct an individual to some websites, which would match with their request. As an example, a consumer will go to a portal to obtain information about some new tires for his car. The portal will offer multiple choices to conduct a search in order to assist the consumer. Usually, the consumer has to enter the name of a company, a brand or the generic word tires.\nIn the present case, the Respondent may not claim to offer such a service as the domain name that is used would imply that only Michelin goods are selected or at least would infer its authorisation.\nThe main competitors of Michelin, such as Pirelli, Goodyear, Bridgestone, are included in the board.\nAnd more specifically, as an example, by selecting the first link \u201cMichelin tires\u201d, the Internet User would assume to be directed to a website presenting tires from Michelin.\nMost of the referenced tire dealers are not linked with Michelin nor refer to its goods, but instead to competitor websites. This causes serious damage to Michelin and misleads Internet users.\nThe Respondent also forces Internet users to access and view the advertisements on those sites as pop ups appear one after another on the screen.\nIn that regard, it has been already held in previous case law that a respondent\u2019s use of banner advertisements and pop up windows in conjunction with a domain name incorporating a complainant\u2019s trademark can be found to be a financially driven attempt to draw Internet users, some of whom were searching for the complainant\u2019s website, to the respondent\u2019s site by taking a free ride on the goodwill of the complainant\u2019s trademark.\nThus, the Domain Names in issue are used in bad faith by the Respondent to primarily direct the public towards Michelin competitors, or globally to websites which are not linked to Michelin or authorised by Michelin.\nFor all those reasons, it is demonstrated that the Respondent has used the Domain Names to intentionally attract Internet users to his website for commercial gain by creating a likelihood of confusion.\nTherefore, the Respondent has registered and uses the domain names in bad faith.\nB.

Orville Smith Ltd., WIPO Case No. DNL2008-0017).\nWanneer het top level domain buiten beschouwing wordt gelaten, is de Domeinnaam identiek aan het Merk van Eiser.

(soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tudes des marques et des proc\u00e9d\u00e9es pour le nettoyage \u00e0 sec S.A.) and the Complainant, according to which this company assigned to Complainant most of the above mentioned trademarks, in which Complainant claims ownership. In this further documentation received by panelist on November 28, 2000, the Complainant further gave evidence of ownership of \u2013 among other - the following trademarks: \"5 a sec\" 123451 in Israel, international trademarks No. R362934 \"5 a sec\", R468352 \"5 a sec\" and 626217 \"5 a sec\", Venezoelan trademark no. 178730 \"5 a sec\", Danish trademark no.

By this additional documentary evidence, Complainant has, to the satisfaction of the Administrative Panel, documented its claim to be owner of rights in the trademark and denomination \"5 a sec\" worldwide.\n4.2 Respondent\u2019s identity and activities\nThe Respondent is the registrant of the domain name 5asec.com. This domain name does not resolve to a website or other online presence. The fact that the Complaint with enclosures could not be served on Respondent at the actual address stated by the Respondent in the contact information of the Whois database of Network Solutions leads to the assumption, that either there are no actual activities at the address given or that the contact information given is false. Prior to filing the Complaint with the Center, the Complainant twice tried to get in contact with Respondent according to letters provided for in annex 10 a and 10 b. To these requests,": [

The Complainant also owns a trademark registration for the COMPIERE mark in Hong Kong, SAR of China. A printout from a SAEGIS Trademark Report showing the Complainant\u2019s International Registration for the trademark COMPIERE, as well as a printout from the Hong Kong, SAR of China trademark database showing the COMPIERE registration has been provided to the Panel.\nThe Complainant registered the domain name <compiere.com> in 2000 and has used the domain name to operate a website continually since that time to promote and make available its Compiere software solutions. The Complainant also registered the domain name <compiere.org> in 2002. The trademark COMPIERE is prominently featured on the Complainant\u2019s website. Selected printouts from the Complainant\u2019s websites have been provided to the Panel.\nThe Complainant\u2019s initial trademark filing, its use of the COMPIERE marks, and its registration of the domain names <compiere.com>and <compiere.org> were all done before the Respondent registered the disputed domain names.\nIn addition, the COMPIERE mark is unique. A search of all available trademark databases on Thomson\u2019s Saegis database \u2013 a widely used commercial trademark database which covers the United States, Canada, virtually all European nations, including the United Kingdom and European Union Community Trademarks (CTM), International Registrations, Australia, Japan and Republic of Korea \u2013 shows only two other trademark applications that even use the term \u201ccompiere\u201d (both of which appear to be in reference to the Complainant\u2019s products, and which are objectionable as they were filed after the Complainant\u2019s applications and/or registrations). A printout from the SAEGIS Trademark database showing these two marks has also been provided to the Panel. Similarly, a search of the Hong Kong, SAR of China trademark database at \u201chttp://ipsearch.ipd.gov.hk/tmlr/jsp/main.jsp\u201d did not reveal any other companies that have applied to register the mark COMPIERE or any mark containing the term COMPIERE.\nThe COMPIERE mark has become widely-known in the open source community. Again, the Complainant\u2019s COMPIERE program has been downloaded over 1,000,000 times, and numerous articles have been written about the Complainant or make reference to the Complainant and its leading open source application, including in industry and trade publications (online and print) such as InfoWorld, CRM Today, ComputerWorld, The Age (Australia), and Business Week Online. In addition, the Complainant has issued numerous press releases that have been distributed by leading wire services such as Business Wire. In short, it is indisputable that the Complainant is the exclusive owner of the COMPIERE trademark.\nFurthermore, the Complainant has licensed selected technology companies to promote and provide support to the Compiere software. While the Compiere solution is open source software and is available to download for free, the Compiere software is backed by professional training, services, documentation, and a vibrant, responsive and knowledgeable worldwide open source community. Notably, the Complainant has a network of partners worldwide that provide implementation, support, training and related services to Compiere end users. The Complainant has these partners undergoing training to familiarize themselves with the COMPIERE solutions, and partners must also sign a Partner Agreement, which strictly controls partners\u2019 rights to use the mark COMPIERE and domain names. The Complainant has created and owns detailed training manuals, user documentation and related materials for the COMPIERE software. The Complainant\u2019s training materials are protected by copyright, and the Complainant and its founders own several copyright registrations in these materials. The Complainant sells its training materials through training seminars that the Complainant conducts for partners or others who pay the required training fees. The Complainant\u2019s user documentation is sold through the Complainant\u2019s web store.\nOn May 3, 2006, the Complainant\u2019s counsel sent a cease and desist letter to the Respondent in which counsel demanded that the Respondent cease use of the disputed domain names and transfer them to the Complainant.

Outside of native English-speaking countries, Yahoo! provides some of its most popular user services through Yahoo! Asia (its English language portal to Southeast Asia), Yahoo! Canada En Fran\u00e7ais (French Canadian Website), and Yahoo! En Espanol (United States Hispanic Website).\n14.              Many of Yahoo!\u2019s current online products and services are offered to the public free of charge, with Yahoo!\u2019s income being derived primarily from display advertising and search advertising on Yahoo!\u2019s online properties as well as some affiliate websites.  Yahoo! also sells sponsorships, promotions, and a wide array of other marketing services to its advertising clients.  Yahoo! serves advertisements for thousands of companies each year, and its advertising clients have included a majority of the \u201cFortune 100\u201d largest advertisers.  Yahoo! also receives revenues from other sources including listings-based services, facilitating commercial transactions, royalties, and consumer and business premium fee-based services offered to consumers and businesses.\n15.              One hundred and eighteen (118) UDRP decisions involving Yahoo!\u2019s marks have been issued in Yahoo!\u2019s favor, and the Panels in more than forty (40) of these cases expressly found the YAHOO! mark to be famous.\nB.      Yahoo!\u2019s Trademark Holdings\n16.              Yahoo!\u2019s YAHOO! mark is protected in countries around the world including the United States.\n17.              Yahoo! owns numerous trademark registrations for the YAHOO! mark in the U.S. including the following representative examples:\na.            Registration 2,403,227, first used June 1994, filed August 13, 1998, issued November 14, 2000, covering telecommunications services, online computer services for a wide range of general interest information, online advertising and retail services, transportation services, and computer software in International Classes 38, 42, 35, 39, and 9.\nb.            Registration 2,040,222, first used June 1, 1994, filed January 24, 1996, issued February 25, 1997, covering online computer services including creating indexes of information and providing online reference materials, software, books, and advertising services in International Classes 42, 9, 16, and 35.\nc.            Registration 2,187,292, first used September 22, 1997, filed February 28, 1997, issued September 8, 1998, covering online computer services in International Class 35.\nd.            Registration No. 2,040,691, first used January 2, 1996, filed April 24, 1996, issued February 25, 1997, covering online computer services including creating indexes of information and providing online reference materials in International Class 42.\n18.              Yahoo!\u2019s trademark rights in its YAHOO! mark and variations thereof predate Respondent\u2019s registration of the Domain Name. \nC.      Respondent\u2019s Infringing Activities and Bad-Faith Acts\n19.              Respondent registered the Domain Name on March 20, 2011, long after Complainant began using its YAHOO! mark, long after Complainant\u2019s YAHOO! mark became famous worldwide, and long after Complainant registered its YAHOO! mark in the U.S. (and elsewhere). \n20.              Respondent uses the Domain Name for a website that purports to be a Yahoo!-authorized website where Yahoo!\u2019s users may submit cancellation requests to Yahoo!.  Specifically, Respondent\u2019s website (a) states \u201cCancel Yahoo!,\u201d with \u201cYahoo!\u201d appearing in Complainant\u2019s signature color of purple, (b) provides a form with input fields for \u201cName\u201d and \u201cReason,\u201d and (c) provides a \u201cSubmit\u201d button, as shown below:\n[image redacted]\n21.              Below the input form on its website, Respondent displays the names and reasons submitted by users, and many of these submissions constitute evidence of actual confusion, where the user\u2019s comment indicates that the user believed he or she was submitting a customer service request directly to Yahoo!.  Examples of such actual confusion are:\nBridget[redacted]\nI cant sign in because I forgot my password. The security question asks me for my daughters nickname. I only have one daughter. [Redacted] is her nickname. So I want to cancel because its not letting me change the password.\n  Linda [redacted]": [

"Republic of Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan Province of China, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay, Venezuela and Viet Nam.\nFor over 16 years the Complainant has continuously and extensively used the BLACKBERRY trademarks in connection with the Complainant\u2019s products. In addition, the Complainant has spent millions of dollars in advertising containing BLACKBERRY trademarks and promoting the Complainant\u2019s products. The Complainant\u2019s marketing efforts, combined with its attention to the quality, design and construction of its products, generate hundreds of millions of dollars in sales each year. By virtue of the Complainant\u2019s long history of use throughout the world and in the United States, as well as the Complainant\u2019s sales and promotional activities, the BLACKBERRY trademarks have generated valuable goodwill.\nThe Respondent registered the disputed domain names more than 10 years after the registration of one of the BLACKBERRY trademarks in the United States and more than 15 years after the Complainant\u2019s first use of the BLACKBERRY trademarks in commerce.\nThe disputed domain names simply combine the Complainant\u2019s BLACKBERRY and BES trademarks with other generic, descriptive terms such as \u201csecure,\u201d \u201ccollection\u201d, \u201ccanada\u201d, and \u201cbritish\u201d and the generic\nTop-level Domains. The disputed domain names are identical or confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s registered BLACKBERRY and BES trademarks. The Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names.\nIt is a well-established principle that a domain name that wholly incorporates a trademark, particularly one that is as famous as the BLACKBERRY and BES trademarks, would likely be found to be confusingly similar for the purposes of the Policy. The addition of generic and descriptive terms does not diminish and in fact only strengthens the confusing similarity between the disputed domain names and the trademarks.\nThe Respondent operates websites connected to a number of the disputed domain names, which offer the Complainant\u2019s products and appear to be created by the Complainant itself. The active websites are designed to appear to be the official websites belonging to or authorized by the Complainant. The BLACKBERRY trademarks appear throughout the active websites, clearly in an attempt to mislead viewers as to the source of the websites. In fact, one of the Respondent\u2019s active websites provides confidential information of a device not yet launched by the Complainant as well as the specifications of the device.\nThe Complainant\u2019s trademark registrations are prima facie evidence of the validity of the BLACKBERRY trademarks, which creates a rebuttable presumption that the Complainant\u2019s trademarks are inherently distinctive. Because the Complainant has made a prima facie showing of its rights in the trademarks, the Respondent must come forward with evidence demonstrating that it has rights in the disputed domain names. Registration of a domain name incorporating another\u2019s famous mark does not confer any rights or legitimate interests in the domain name, but rather constitutes bad faith under paragraph 4(b) of the Policy. Where, as here, the Complainant\u2019s trademarks and name are so well-known and so widely recognized, there can be no legitimate use by the Respondent.\nThe Complainant\u2019s BLACKBERRY trademark has been the subject of a significant number of prior proceedings under the Policy, in which other panels have found that the Complainant\u2019s trademark is distinctive, famous and indeed at the stronger end of the spectrum.\nThe Respondent had knowledge of the Complainant\u2019s trademarks when the Respondent registered the disputed domain names. The Respondent\u2019s registration and use of the disputed domain names is nothing but a misappropriation of the Complainant\u2019s trademarks. The collateral use of the trademark in connection with the resale of the Complainant\u2019s products on the Respondent\u2019s website does not confer any proprietary rights in the Complainant\u2019s trademark on the Respondent.\nThe fact that the Respondent\u2019s websites display the Complainant\u2019s trademarks in a commercial manner suggests, contrary to fact, that the Respondent is an authorized reseller of the Complainants products. In addition, the Respondent\u2019s failure to disclose its lack of authorization by the Complainant leads to the conclusion that the Respondent is seeking to create an impression of association with the Complainant, which does not constitute a bona fide offering of goods or services or a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the disputed domain name.\nThere exists no relationship between the Complainant and the Respondent that would give rise to any license, permission or authorization by which the Respondent could own or use disputed domain names that incorporate the Complainant\u2019s trademarks. The Respondent is not commonly known by the disputed domain names and is not making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of Complainant\u2019s trademarks. Accordingly, the Respondent lacks any rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain names.\nThe Respondent registered and is using the disputed domain names in bad faith. The registration of a domain name obviously connected with well-known trademarks by someone without any connection to these trademarks suggests opportunistic bad faith. Furthermore, the Respondent\u2019s use of the trademarks in the disputed domain names and the Respondent\u2019s use of the trademarks throughout the Respondent\u2019s active websites to sell the Complainant\u2019s products show that the Respondent is using the disputed domain names in bad faith.\nThe unauthorized use of the Complainant\u2019s trademarks on the websites and the disputed domain names will undoubtedly create a likelihood of confusion with the Complainant\u2019s trademarks as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of the Respondent\u2019s websites and products.\nThe Respondent\u2019s unauthorized use of the disputed domain names in connection with the inactive websites evidences its bad faith registration and use of the disputed domain names because in violation to Policy, paragraph 4(b)(ii), the Respondent has engaged in a pattern of registering the disputed domain names to prevent the Complainant from reflecting the BLACKBERRY and BES trademarks in corresponding domain names.\nThe Respondent is using the active websites intentionally to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to his websites or other online locations, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant\u2019s trademarks as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of a website or location or of a product or service on a web site or location in violation of Policy, paragraph 4(b)(iv). As even more evidence of bad faith, the Respondent has inappropriately disseminated confidential information regarding a device not yet launched by the Complainant.\nBased on all of the above, it is evident that the Complainant has met the requirements of the Policy by demonstrating not only its own legitimate interest in its trademarks, as evidenced by its use of those trademarks, but also that the Respondent registered and has used the disputed domain names in bad faith, and that Respondent\u2019s interest is to unlawfully profit from the use of the Complainant\u2019s trademarks and prevent the Complainant from registering the domain names.\nB.

"Dubai, U.A.E is a legally registered company in the United Arab Emirates with all legal documentation from necessary government departments and has no intention of conflict with the complainant in any means. The trade name approval process in Dubai Economic Department of U.A.E follows certain procedures to validate Trade Names and the same is applicable for this company. The complainant has also initiated a proceeding with Dubai Economic Department regarding the trade name and the responded is working with the Dubai Economic Department and Complainant\u2019s representative in this region Rouse & Co International to resolve the dispute in Trade Name and the domain.\nBad Faith Registration of the Domain\nThe Registrant/Responded would like to clarify that there is no bad faith in the registration of the disputed domain as the company operates under the name Costco General Trading L.L.C which is legally registered with Economic Department in Dubai, U.A.E. and it has opted to use the name in domain. The Responded is no way related to the complainant or neither trading same products as complainant as in the online store www.costco.com The complainant has no physical presence in this region which could be a reason to have caused the issue at the first place. Therefore their presence is completely unknown until the responded received the first communication from Rouse & Co, representing the Complainant in this region. We are working on resolving this issue with the complainant in the Department of Economy in Dubai which also includes the disputed domain, in U.A.E. and would request WIPO to keep this case on hold till we reach a resolution at Dubai Economic Department which includes Trade Name and the domain name. We will communicate to you on the updates of the issue as we reach a conclusion.\u201d\nIt is also convenient to set out verbatim the substantive content of the Respondent\u2019s Supplemental Statement, as follows [all errors present in original]:\n\u201c1. Respondent\u2019s status as an incorporated company in the United Arab Emirates and showing its date of incorporation. (Attached in email, the Commercial License for reference).\n2. Details on activity carried out, customer numbers and turn over, we are not in the position to share this information at this point, as couple of our board of directors are currently on vacation and are unavailable and it may not be possible to share financial details without approval.\n3. It is a process to propose few names to the Licensing authority when selecting the trade name and Costco general trading was one of the other options. The licensing department had selected Costco General Trading out of the options provided. \u2018General Trading\u2019 is one of the common licensing type used in UAE and the it was opted by the company.\u201d\n6. Discussion and Findings\nJoint Complainants\nThe Panel accepts the Complainants\u2019 submission that for the purposes of this dispute, the interests of the Complainants are co-extensive, and their grievance against the Respondent arises from common legal interests. The Panel agrees that it is equitable and procedurally efficient to consolidate the claims of Costco Wholesale Corporation and Price Costco International, Inc. See WIPO Overview of WIPO Panel Views on Selected UDRP Questions, Second Edition (\u201cWIPO Overview 2.0\u201d), paragraph 4.16 and panel decisions cited therein.\nSubstantive Issues\nParagraph 4(a) of the Policy states that the Complainant must prove each of the three following elements:\ni. the Disputed Domain Name is identical to or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the Complainants have rights;\nii. the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the Disputed Domain Name;\niii. the Disputed Domain Name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\nA. Identical or Confusingly Similar\nThe Complainants have submitted detailed evidence that they are the owner of numerous trademarks consisting of the word \u201cCOSTCO\u201d.\nThe Panel holds that the Disputed Domain Name is confusingly similar to the above trademarks. The Disputed Domain Name, as registered by the Respondent, incorporates the COSTCO trademark. Previous UDRP panels have consistently held that domain names are identical or confusingly similar to a trademark for purposes of the Policy, \u201cwhen the domain name includes the trademark, or a confusingly similar approximation, regardless of the other terms in the domain name\u201d (Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Richard MacLeod d/b/a For Sale, WIPO Case No. D2000-0662). The only differences in the present case is the addition of the letters \u201cuae\u201d which are clearly a generic term being a common geographical abbreviation for the United Arab Emirates. This addition does not suffice to negate the similarity between the Disputed Domain Name and the Complainant\u2019s COSTCO trademark - it is established that, where a mark is the distinctive part of a disputed domain name, the disputed domain name is considered to be confusingly similar to the registered mark (DHL Operations B.V. v. DHL Packers, WIPO Case No. D2008-1694).\nAccordingly the Panel finds that the Disputed Domain Name is confusingly similar to the Complainants\u2019 trademark and hence the first condition of paragraph 4(a) of the Policy has been fulfilled.\nB. Rights or Legitimate Interests\nParagraph 4(c) of the Policy non-exhaustively lists three circumstances that demonstrate a right or legitimate interest in a domain name:\ni. before any notice to you of the dispute, your use of, or demonstrable preparations to use the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services; or\nii. you (as an individual, business or other organisation) have been commonly known by the domain name, even if you have acquired no trademark or service mark rights; or\niii. you are making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name, without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue.\nIn the present circumstances the Complainant has not authorised, licensed, or permitted the Respondent to register or use the Disputed Domain Name or to use the COSTCO trademark. The Complainant has prior rights in the COSTCO trademark which precede the Respondent\u2019s registration of the Disputed Domain Name. The Complainant has therefore established a prima facie case that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the Disputed Domain Name and thereby the burden of production shifts to the Respondent to produce evidence demonstrating rights or legitimate interests in respect of the Disputed Domain Name (see for example Do The Hustle, LLC v. Tropic Web, WIPO Case No. D2000-0624; Croatia Airlines d.d. v. Modern Empire Internet Ltd., WIPO Case No. D2003-0455).\nAs the Panel understands it, the Respondent\u2019s case is that the Disputed Domain Name simply reflects its corporate name, and that it selected its corporate name, and hence the Disputed Domain Name, with no knowledge of the Complainant. It appears from the copy of the license filed with the Respondent\u2019s Supplemental Statement that the Respondent came into existence in May 2014. Looking at the evidence as a whole the Panel on the balance of probabilities does not accept that the Respondent was unaware of the Complainant at the time it chose its name and registered the Disputed Domain Name. The Panel is conscious that proceedings under the UDRP are of a limited and restricted nature, do not involve oral hearings, discovery or cross examination, and hence are only applicable to clear cut cases, and it is not usually appropriate to decide disputed questions of fact or matters of truth or falsehood. That does not however mean the Panel cannot reach a conclusion as to the veracity of a case that is being advanced where the only evidence that is provided is in the form of conclusory statements that are inherently not credible, and which are not supported by relevant corrobative or third party evidence. The Panel considers this to be such a case. The Panel reaches this conclusion for the following reasons:\n1. The filed evidence establishes the Complainants were very well known internationally by 2014.\n2. Although the Complainants had no physical presence in Dubai the evidence establishes they were likely to be well known in the emirate at least to persons engaged in business or commerce with an international connection.\n3. The word \u201ccostco\u201d is a made up word with no separate independent meaning.\n4. The Complainants had a trademark registration in the United Arab Emirates for the word \u201cCOSTCO\u201d. Whilst there is no specific obligation upon a registrant of a domain name to carry out trademark searches had the Respondent done so it would have readily found this mark.\n5. Even if in the light of the above the Respondent and/or those involved in establishing the Respondent had no actual knowledge of the Complainants (which seems to the Panel to be highly unlikely) even the most cursory of Internet searches would have quickly identified the Complainants and the nature and size of their business \u2013 the Panel cannot believe that such a search was not performed, particularly given the Respondent\u2019s professed area of business in the supply of IT related services.\n6. In addition the name \u201cCostco General Trading\u201d seems to the Panel to be a peculiarly inappropriate name for the Respondent to adopt if its business really is, as its website portrays, the supply and installation of structured cabling and other related IT services. Nothing in the name bears any relation whatsoever to this area of business. The Procedural Order issued by the Panel provided the Respondent with an opportunity to explain this peculiarity, but the Respondent\u2019s Supplemental Statement provides no further meaningful information on this issue.\n7. In addition if the Respondent was operating a genuine business under its name it is to be expected it would be able to provide details of that business in terms of size, numbers of customers and so on. Again the Procedural Order issued by the Panel provided the Respondent with an opportunity to provide such information, but the Respondent\u2019s Supplemental Statement provides no further meaningful information on this issue.\nAccordingly the Panel concludes the Respondent adopted its name and the Disputed Domain Name with knowledge of the Complainants and their rights in the word \u201cCOSTCO\u201d. In those circumstances the Panel declines to find that the Respondent has the benefit of any of the circumstances listed in paragraph 4(c) of the Policy. Accordingly the Panel finds that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the Disputed Domain Name and the second condition of paragraph 4(a) of the Policy has been fulfilled.\nC. Registered and Used in Bad Faith\nIn the present circumstances, the distinctive nature of the COSTCO trademark, and the evidence as to the extent of the reputation the Complainants enjoy in the COSTCO trademark, and the confusingly similar nature of the Disputed Domain Name to the COSTCO trademark, and the lack of any credible explanation from the Respondent as to why it chose its name and why it registered the Disputed Domain Name leads the Panel to conclude the registration and use was in bad faith. In the present case, the Panel concludes that on the balance of probabilities the Respondent did not select the Disputed Domain Name independently and without knowledge of the Complainants or their trademark.\nThe website operated by the Respondent at the Disputed Domain Name purports to promote a business involving the supply and installation of structured cabling and other related IT services. The website comprises three pages under the titles \u201cHome\u201d, \u201cServices\u201d and \u201cContact\u201d and is of a relatively basic nature. The contact page provides details of the Respondent\u2019s address and a Google map showing its location. Having looked at this website the Panel was unable to conclude that it provided reasonable corroboration of a genuine business being operated by the Respondent. The Panel\u2019s Procedural Order invited the Respondent to provide further information substantiating its business activities, but its Supplemental Statement has not done so. In the circumstances, on the balance of probabilities the Panel concludes the Respondent has failed to show that it is engaged in a bona fide business of the type portrayed on its website.\nThe Panel concludes that the Respondent chose to register a name comprising the Complainants\u2019 widely known trademark combined with a generic geographical identifier. The evidence before the Panel does not provide sufficient material for the Panel to reach a conclusion on exactly what the Respondent\u2019s intention was in so doing. Under paragraph 4(b) of the Policy a non-exhaustive list of factors evidencing registration and use in bad faith comprises:\n(i) circumstances indicating that you have registered or you have acquired the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration in excess of your documented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain name; or\n(ii) you have registered the domain name in order to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, provided that you have engaged in a pattern of such conduct; or\n(iii) you have registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor; or\n(iv) by using the domain name, you have intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to your web site or other on-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of your web site or location or of a product or service on your web site or location.\nIn the present circumstances factor (ii) is not applicable but the Panel cannot clearly determine which, if any, of the other factors may apply. However the Panel notes that in any event this list is non-exhaustive and accepts the Complainants\u2019 submission that the registration of the Disputed Domain Name with knowledge of the Complainants\u2019 widely known trademark is itself evidence of bad faith \u2013 see The Channel Tunnel Group Ltd. v. John Powell, WIPO Case No. D2000-0038. This is particularly so given that the Respondent has been provided with an express request to explain how and why it chose its corporate name and hence the Disputed Domain Name, but has not provided any meaningful response to that request.\nAccordingly the Panel finds that the Disputed Domain Name has been registered and is being used in bad faith. Accordingly the third condition of paragraph 4(a) of the Policy has been fulfilled.\n7. Decision\nFor all the foregoing reasons, in accordance with paragraphs 4(i) of the Policy and 15 of the Rules, the Panel orders that the Disputed Domain Name <costcouae.com> be transferred to Price Costco International, Inc.\n": [

Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA.

The mere addition of the term \u201cmail\u201d is generic and hence does not have any impact on the risk of confusion.\nThe Complainant further argues that the Respondent has no right or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain name, as there is no relationship between the Respondent and the Complainant.\nFinally, the Complainant argues that disputed domain name was registered and is being used in bad faith, in particular due to the fact that despite several letters and reminders, the Respondent has never replied to the letters nor transferred the disputed domain name back to the Complainant.\nB.

"Kuwait City, Kyoto, Macau, Niigata, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai, Shenyang, Sungnamsi, Taipei and Tokyo, amongst others.\nIt owns more than 700 trademark registrations worldwide, including in Asian countries, such as Japan, Republic of Korea, Viet Nam, Mongolia, Singapore and also China where the Respondent is located, consisting of, or containing the mark and words LORO PIANA, and more that 300 domain names incorporating the words \u201cloro piana\u201d.\nThe Respondent uses the disputed domain name for a parking page that features pay-per-click links, including sponsored links that resolve to third party websites offering products like cashmere products, which compete with the Complainant\u2019s products.\n5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\nThe Complainant contends that it is the world\u2019s foremost cashmere manufacturer and the largest single buyer of the finest wool. As noted above, it contends that it owns more than 700 trade mark registrations around the world, including in China, where the Respondent is based.\nThe Complainant also contends that it has invested considerable resources in developing its reputation in the LORO PIANA trademark. The Complainant has for several decades successfully been using its LORO PIANA mark primarily in the areas of wool and cashmere and contends that its trademark should be regarded as a well known and famous trademark.\nIt also owns more than 300 domain names containing the LORO PIANA trademark, including the domain names <loropiana.asia> and <loro-piana.asia>.\nThe Complainant contends that the disputed domain name is identical or confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademarks. It points out that the Complainant\u2019s trademarks consist of the term \u201cloro piana\u201d while the disputed domain name also consists of the term \u201cloro piana\u201d but with the addition of the common conjunction \u201cand\u201d between \u201cloro\u201d and \u201cpiana\u201d. The disputed domain name ends with the generic Top Level Domain (gTLD) \u201c.asia\u201d, which the Complainant argues is not to be taken into consideration when assessing the similarity between a trademark and a domain name, as gTLDs have no distinctive character.\nThe Complainant argues that the conjunction \u201cand\u201d which divides the words \u201cloro\u201d and \u201cpiana\u201d in the disputed domain name does not alter the perception of identity between the Complainant\u2019s trademarks and the disputed domain name.\nThe Complainant also argues that the name \u201cloro piana\u201d has no meaning in Italian or in any other language since it corresponds to the surname of the family which created the company.\nThe Complainant therefore contends that the disputed domain name is identical or confusingly similar to Complainant\u2019s earlier marks, and that the requirement of paragraph 4(a)(i) of the Policy is satisfied.\nThe Complainant contends, secondly, that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain name.\nThe Complainant contends that the Respondent cannot demonstrate any legitimate interest in the disputed domain name.\nThe Respondent is not commonly known by the disputed domain name. It has not been granted any authorization, license or other rights to use the Complainant\u2019s marks or to register them as part of any domain name or for any other purpose. The Complainant is in no way associated or affiliated with the Respondent.\nThe Complainant contends that the Respondent is not using the disputed domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services. The Respondent is using the disputed domain name for a parking page featuring pay-per-click links, including sponsored links that resolve to third party websites offering products like cashmere products, which compete with the Complainant\u2019s products and generate revenue for the Respondent.\nThe Complainant also asserts that on May 24, 2012, the Complainant received an e-mail from an individual named Duan offering for sale the disputed domain name and other domain names, identical to Complainant\u2019s trademark, in other extensions. The Complainant noticed that the person who was offering for sale these domain names was the same individual who on August 31, 2011, offered for sale the domain name <loro-piana.asia> that was transferred to the Complainant following the decision in Loro Piana S.p.A. v. Mr. Sun King, WIPO Case No. D2011-1871. Furthermore, the Complainant contends that the website corresponding to the disputed domain name is used to offer for sale the disputed domain name. When the Internet user clicks on the links appearing on the website, the user is redirected to an offer page, where an offer to purchase the disputed domain name can be submitted.\nThe Complainant therefore contends that there is no evidence of the Respondent\u2019s use of, or demonstrable preparations to use the disputed domain name with a bona fide offering of goods or services, that the Respondent has no connection with the Complainant, and the Complainant did not license or authorize the Respondent to use the disputed domain name or its trademarks, there is no evidence that the Respondent is commonly known by the disputed domain name and the Respondent is not making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the disputed domain name. In the light of the foregoing, the Complainant contends that the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the disputed domain name and that the requirement under paragraph 4(a)(ii) of the Policy is satisfied.\nThe Complainant contends, thirdly, that the disputed domain name has been registered and is used in bad faith.\nThe Complainant contends that given the extensive and longstanding use of the LORO PIANA trademark all over the world, including in Asia and specifically in China, which is the country of the Respondent, the Respondent must have been aware of the Complainant\u2019s trademarks prior to registering the disputed domain name. \u201cLoro piana\u201d is not a descriptive or generic term; it cannot be found in a dictionary, nor is it commonly used in Chinese or other languages. Loro Piana is an uncommon family name, and the fact that the Respondent chose to register the disputed domain name identical to this family name clearly demonstrates that that the Respondent must have known of the existence of the Complainant and its trademarks and intended to ride on the Complainant\u2019s reputation by registering the disputed domain name.\nThe Complainant also asserts that the Respondent contacted the Complainant in order to offer for sale the disputed domain name and other domain names identical to its trademark and that the Respondent was the same individual who offered for sale the domain name <loro-piana.asia> in earlier UDRP proceedings, specifically, Loro Piana S.p.A. v. Mr. Sun King, WIPO Case No. D2011-1871, in which the UDRP panel transferred the domain name <loro-piana.asia> to the Complainant.\nThe Complainant further asserts that the Respondent has registered various other domain names identical to well-known trademarks and has been offering them for sale. The Complainant has produced evidence of such offers for sale of the domain name <loccitane.biz> (identical to the well-known trademark L\u2019OCCITANE), the domain name <guerlain.info> (identical to the well-known trademark GUERLAIN), and the domain name <avene.asia> (identical to the well-known trademark AVENE).\nThe Complainant contends that the Respondent registered these domain names for the purpose of selling them to the legitimate owners of the well-known trademarks and there has been a pattern of such conduct.\nThe Complainant contends that the undisputed facts and circumstances establish that the Respondent used and is using the disputed domain name to gain profit from the pay-per-click links and to intentionally attract for commercial gain Internet users to its website or other on-line location \u2013 some of which belonging to the Complainant\u2019s competitors \u2013 by creating a likelihood of confusion with the Complainant\u2019s mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of its website; that the Respondent registered the disputed domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the disputed domain name registration to the Complainant who is the owner of the trademark, for valuable consideration in excess of its out-of-pocket costs, and that the Respondent registered the disputed domain name in order to prevent the Complainant from reflecting its mark in a corresponding domain name, as demonstrated by the fact that the Respondent registered several variations of the LORO PIANA trademark, under different extensions, and has therefore clearly engaged in a pattern of such conduct.\nThe Complainant consequently argues that the Complainant\u2019s business is being disrupted by the use of the disputed domain name and this use is misleading Internet users and creating a likelihood of confusion with the Complainant\u2019s trademark and business.\nB.

The Complainant is active also on the main Social Media with official accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube and LinkedIn.\n\nIn the case at issue, the disputed domain name was registered on May 12, 2003, and it is currently redirected to a Sedo\u2019s parking page with various sponsored links.\n\nAs soon as the Complainant became aware of the Respondent\u2019s registration and use of the disputed domain name, confusingly similar to its registered trademark PESERICO, it instructed its representative to address to the owner of the domain name a cease and desist letter in order to notify it of the infringement of the Complainant\u2019s trademark rights, requesting the immediate cease of any use, and the transfer of, the disputed domain name to the Complainant.\n\nA cease and desist letter was therefore sent, on April 16, 2019, by e-mail to the Respondent\u2019s known e-mail addresses indicated in the WhoIs record; the Respondent replied on the same day refusing to transfer the disputed domain name explaining that the disputed domain name was registered for it\u2019s future business without any further explanation.\n\nIn light of the failure to comply with the request to transfer the disputed domain name, the Complainant instructed its representative to file the present Complaint in order to obtain the transfer of the disputed domain name under its ownership and control.\n\nA. Identical or confusingly similar\n\nThe disputed domain name <peserico.com> is identical to the trademark PESERICO in which the Complainant has rights, as highlighted by the copies of the trademark registration certificates and printouts of the trademark records published on the online database of the competent Trademark Offices.\n\nMoreover, the top level \u201c.com\u201d is merely instrumental to the use in Internet - as found in The Forward Association, Inc., v. Enterprises Unlimited (FORUM case FA0008000095491, October 3, 2000) and numerous others - and not able to affect the identity of the Domain Names to the Complainant\u2019s trademark.\n\nTherefore, the disputed domain name fully incorporates the word element of the Complainant\u2019s trademark. As indicated in the decision for No Zebra Network Ltda v. Baixaki.com, Inc. Case No. D2009-1071: \u201chaving determined, on the limited record presented in this proceeding, that BAIXAKI appears to be a mark in which the Complainant has rights, the Panel must next assess whether the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to that trademark. The disputed domain name fully incorporates the word element of the Complainant's BAIXAKI Mark\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, in the FORUM decision where the holder of the Domain Name was the Respondent, i.e. TSC Apparel, LLC v. ryusung Claim Number FA1804001780393 it is highlighted that \u201ca trademark registered with a national authority is evidence of trademark rights. Since Complainant evidences its registration of the trademark with USPTO the Panel finds that it has shown trademark rights. The disputed domain name takes the whole of the trademark to which it simply adds the gTLD, \u201c.com\u201d. The Panel finds that the disputed domain name is identical to the trademark for the purposes of the Policy\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, on the Respondent\u2019s website corresponding to the disputed domain name, sponsored links to Complainant\u2019s competitors are displayed. Such use of the disputed domain name suggests that the goal of the Respondent is to give the idea to the consumers that they have received the Complainant\u2019s authorization.\n\nIn light of the above, the disputed domain name is certainly identical to the prior registered trademarks in which the Complainant has rights pursuant to paragraph 4(a)(i) of the Policy.\n\nB. No rights or legitimate interests\n\nAs a preliminary note, along the lines set forth in Pharmacia & Upjohn Company v. Moreonline, WIPO Case No. D2000-0134 and National Football League Properties, Inc. and Chargers Football Company v. One Sex Entertainment Co., a/k/a chargergirls.net, WIPO Case No. D2000-0118, the mere registration of a domain name does not establish rights or legitimate interests in a disputed domain name.\n\nThe Respondent is not an authorized dealer of the Complainant nor has ever been authorized by the Complainant to use the trademark PESERICO in the disputed domain name.\n\nThe Complainant is not in possession of, nor aware of the existence of, any evidence demonstrating that the Respondent, whose name is prima facie Ryusung, might be commonly known by the disputed domain name or a name corresponding to the disputed domain name as an individual, business, or other organization.\n\nThe Respondent has not provided the Complainant with any evidence of its use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the disputed domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services before any notice of the dispute.\n\nIn the case at hand, \u201cPESERICO\u201d is neither a generic term, nor descriptive, and it is not a dictionary word, rather it is an inherently distinctive trademark which solely refers to - and should belong to the Complainant. As anticipated, the word PESERICO comes from Maria Peserico, the founder of the Confezioni Peserico S.p.a. in 1962.\n\nConsidered that no relationship has ever been established between the parties and no lawful connection to the denomination \u201cPESERICO\u201d appears from the records either, the Complainant could not find any evidence on which to ground the assumption that the Respondent is making a bona fide offering of goods or services related to the denomination \u201cPESERICO\u201d.\n\nRather, the Complainant contends that the Respondent has registered the disputed domain name - which is identical to the Complainant\u2019s trademark - to prevent the owner of the trademark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, since the disputed domain name - at present - is connected to a parking page with various sponsored links. Therefore, the disputed domain name is not in use in any meaningful manner.\n\nThe above-described use of the disputed domain name suggests that the Respondent intended to trade upon the Complainant\u2019s trademarks by intentionally attempting to attract to a parking page with various sponsored links users looking for the Complainant by misleading them as to the source or affiliation of its website.\n\nAccording to the decision Media General Communications, Inc. v. Rarenames, WebReg, WIPO Case No. D2006-0964, using domain names for advertising links can in certain circumstances represent legitimate interests for the purposes of paragraph 4(c) of the Policy, such as when the following criteria are all met:\n\n- the respondent regularly engages in the business of registering and reselling domain names, and/or using them to display advertising links;\n\n- the respondent makes good-faith efforts to avoid registering and using domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to marks held by others;\n\n- the domain name in question is a \u201cdictionary word\u201d or a generic or descriptive phrase;\n\n- the domain name is not identical or confusingly similar to a famous or distinctive trademark; and\n\n- there is no evidence that the respondent had actual knowledge of the complainant\u2019s mark.\n\nThe Respondent here is clearly in the business of reselling domain names on a large scale and using them, at least in the interim, to point to websites with advertising links. But the Response does not indicate what steps, if any, the Respondent takes in good faith to avoid registering, using, and selling domain names that correspond to trademarks. The domain name in question is a short string of letters, but it is not a dictionary word or descriptive phrase. Rather, it is suspiciously identical to the Complainant\u2019s arbitrary mark.\n\nThus, the determination of legitimacy in this case largely hinges on the question of bad faith, which is better addressed below in connection with the third element of the Policy. If the Respondent registered and used the disputed domain name, and offered it for sale, in good faith, then we must conclude that the Respondent had a legitimate interest in the disputed domain name as it does in hundreds of thousands of other domain names in its portfolio. On the other hand, if the Respondent failed to act in good faith, by registering and using a non-generic domain name that it should have realized was likely to correspond to a trademark, then the Respondent has no legitimate interest in this particular Domain Name\u201d.\n\nIn the case at hand, the disputed domain name is identical to the Complainant\u2019s trademark, active in the sector of female clothes since many years and in the Republic of Korea since 2015. Indeed, the registered trademark PESERICO has been used extensively and exclusively by the Complainant since 1987 and through long established and widespread use since 1962, the aforesaid trademark of the Complainant enjoys worldwide reputation in the sector of female clothing.\n\nThe disputed domain name was registered in the name of the Respondent on April 2016, years after the Complainant obtained its trademark registrations, including in the Republic of Korea, where the Respondent is located. According to the searches in the whois history database, the disputed domain name was registered in the name of the Respondent on April 15, 2016, some months later the signature of the agreement with the Korean distributor. By such a peculiar coincidence, it could be assumed that the Respondent was aware of the Complainant\u2019s trademark.\n\nAs anticipated, the Complainant has various stores and showrooms worldwide, including in the Republic of Korea where it is active since 2015 with an official distributor, i.e. Aabang CO. Ltd. http://www.aabang.co.kr/. The agreement with the Korean distributor was signed in 2015": [

Procedural History\nThe procedures for resolving Complaints like this one are governed by the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (hereafter \"The Policy\") adopted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\"ICANN\") on August 26, 1999, ICANN\u2019s Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (hereafter \"The Rules\"), as well as the Supplemental Rules of the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center (hereafter \"The Supplemental Rules\").\nThe current dispute lies within the scope of the Policy, so that this WIPO Administrative Panel does have proper jurisdiction to hear and decide this dispute.

"C\u00e1diz, M\u00e1laga, Almer\u00eda y Antequera (Unicaja) v. Fernando Labad\u00eda Pardo\"; OMPI No. D2000-1502, \"Banco Urquijo, S.A. v. Fernando Labad\u00eda Pardo\"). De hecho, la parte demandante en este procedimiento (Caja de Ahorros del Mediterr\u00e1neo) tiene en cuenta esta doctrina previa de los grupos de expertos y realiza una serie de consideraciones en su demanda sobre el Derecho espa\u00f1ol de marcas y sobre el Derecho represor de la competencia desleal, que a su juicio pueden ser utilizados por este Grupo de expertos para emitir la presente resoluci\u00f3n.\nPor todas estas razones se proceder\u00e1 a analizar el presente caso a la luz de la Pol\u00edtica y el Reglamento de la ICANN, as\u00ed como del Derecho espa\u00f1ol de marcas y de la competencia desleal.\n6.2. Examen de los presupuestos para la estimaci\u00f3n de la demanda contenidos en el apartado 4 a) de la Pol\u00edtica Uniforme de la ICANN\nDe acuerdo con el apartado 4.1 a) de la Pol\u00edtica la solicitud del demandante s\u00f3lo prosperar\u00e1 cuando se cumplan las siguientes condiciones, cuya prueba corresponde al demandante:\n- que el nombre de dominio registrado por el demandado sea id\u00e9ntico u ofrezca semejanza que produzca la confusi\u00f3n con una marca de productos o servicios sobre la que el demandante tenga derechos;\n- que el demandado carezca de derechos o intereses leg\u00edtimos en relaci\u00f3n con el nombre de dominio; y\n- que el nombre de dominio haya sido registrado y usado de mala fe.\n6.2.1. Identidad o confundibilidad entre el nombre de dominio y una marca sobre la que el demandante tenga derechos\nEl primer requisito del p\u00e1rrafo 4.1 a) de la Pol\u00edtica se compone en realidad de dos presupuestos: que exista identidad o semejanza hasta el punto de crear confusi\u00f3n entre el nombre de dominio y una marca ajena, y que el demandante tenga derechos sobre dicha marca.\nHa quedado suficientemente acreditado que la demandante es titular registral de varias marcas espa\u00f1olas que protegen la denominaci\u00f3n \"Caja del Mediterr\u00e1neo\" y la denominaci\u00f3n \"CAM Caja de Ahorros del Mediterr\u00e1neo\", as\u00ed como de una marca comunitaria sobre esta \u00faltima denominaci\u00f3n.\nEste Grupo administrativo de expertos considera que existe una clara semejanza entre los nombres de dominio <cajamediterraneo.com> y <cajamediterraneo.net> y las marcas de la demandante constituidas por las denominaciones \"Caja del Mediterr\u00e1neo\" y \"CAM Caja de ahorros del Mediterr\u00e1neo\". La comparaci\u00f3n entre los signos ha de hacerse prescindiendo del nombre de dominio de primer nivel, conforme a numerosas decisiones de Grupos de expertos cuya cita es innecesaria. Asimismo, deben obviarse los elementos gr\u00e1ficos de las marcas registradas, dado que los condicionantes t\u00e9cnicos de los nombres de dominio impiden en \u00e9stos la existencia de esos elementos. Y con estos presupuestos, la identidad o semejanza entre las marcas y los nombres de dominio debe apreciarse atendiendo a los elementos que gozan de una mayor fuerza distintiva. En el presente caso es claro que estos elementos son \"Caja\" y \"Mediterr\u00e1neo\", de forma que a juicio de este Grupo de expertos existe una clara semejanza que induce a confusi\u00f3n entre los signos \"cajamediterraneo\" y \"Caja del Mediterr\u00e1neo\" y \"CAM Caja de Ahorros del Mediterr\u00e1neo\"": [

It has been successively renewed and is currently valid to identify, in international class NCL (7) 36, \u201cbank services.\u201d (Annex F to the Complaint).\nDue to the great recognition in the Brazilian Market this mark was declared notorious by the Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (the Brazilian Patents and Trademarks Office).\nThe Complainant is also the owner, in Brazil, of other 333 trademarks registrations incorporating the expression BRADESCO, all of which are currently valid (Annex F-1 to the Complaint).\nThe Complainant is the owner of several BRADESCO trademarks around the world comprising Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, Republic of Bolivia, Cayman Islands, Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Republic of Cuba, Cura\u00e7ao, Dominican Republic, Republic of Ecuador, Republic of El Salvador, Republic of Guatemala, Republic of Honduras, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Nicaragua, Republic of Panama, Republic of Paraguay, Republic of Peru, Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa, Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America, and Eastern Republic of Uruguay (Annex F-2 to the Complaint).\nThe Complainant owns the domain names <bradesco.com.br> and <bradescoseguranca.com>, of which the latter is identical to the disputed domain name, among other domain names containing the mark BRADESCO (Annex G to the Complaint).\nFor more than 20 years, the Complainant has used and extensively marketed the BRADESCO mark in connection with bank services.\nOn March 27, 2013, more than 20 years after the first registration of the Complainant\u2019s mark that is extensively used the disputed domain name <bradescoseguranca.info> was registered (Annex D to the Complaint).\n5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\nThe Complainant argues that the disputed domain name <bradescoseguranca.info> is confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademark BRADESCO and the Respondent should be considered as having no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the disputed domain name because it does not own any registration for the trademark or name BRADESCO. In addition, the Complainant is also owner of the identical domain name <bradescoseguranca.com>.\nThe Complainant states that \u201cIf the domain name is of the free choice of the interested party, it must necessarily be found among expressions which are free for adoption, and not among trade names and registered trademarks belonging to third parties, and insofar as those distinctive signs constitute absolute rights, are opposable to undue use, as is determined by the rules of 8 \u201cICANN - Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\u201d, which regulates the \u201c.com\u201d domain names\u201d.\nIt is evident for the Complainant that the disputed domain name <bradescoseguranca.info> is confusingly similar to the BRADESCO trademark, to which it has prior and unencumbered rights.\nThe Complainant claims that the possibility of confusion is evident, saying that the disputed domain name <bradescoseguranca.info> is composed of the Complainant\u2019s trademark BRADESCO, and the term \u201cseguran\u00e7a\u201d, which is the Portuguese word for \u201csecurity\u201d and argues that this leads to the conclusion that the disputed domain name <bradescoseguranca.info> is confusingly similar to the Complainant\u2019s trademarks.\nThe Complainant argues that \u201cbradesco\u201d is not a generic term, nor descriptive of the Complainant\u2019s products, and is not a dictionary word neither in Portuguese, English, French or Italian.\n\u201cBradesco\u201d is a coined word created by the joining of the first letters of the Complainant\u2019s previous commercial name (Banco BRAsileiro de DESCOntos) and as far as it is known, the Respondent\u2019s activities do not relate to the products commercialized under the BRADESCO trademark and the Respondent has never been known to be related or associated to said mark.\nFinally, the Complainant argues that the Respondent seems to have no interest in the disputed domain name, since there is no webpage related to the disputed domain name.\nIf there is no webpage related to the disputed domain name, it is possible to ensure that the only plausible explanation for the Respondent\u2019s selection of the domain name is to exploit in an unauthorized fashion the reputation and goodwill of the Complainant and its names and marks, and conclude that the bad faith of the Respondent can be deduced also by the fact that the Respondent has used the notorious trademark BRADESCO as the major component of the disputed domain name, in circumstances in which the Respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in the trademark.\nB.

The disputed domain name resolves to a website selling the products under the Complainant\u2019s AMBIEN trademark as well as other products related to Viagra, Cialis, Valium, among others.\n5. Parties\u2019 Contentions\nA. Complainant\nComplainant contends that the disputed domain name is confusingly similar to Complainant\u2019s registered trademarks and domain names. The product Complainant sells under the AMBIEN mark is a well-established sleeping aid. The addition of the term \u201cbuying\u201d placed before AMBIEN in the disputed domain name, and the generic Top-Level Domain (\u201cgTLD\u201d) extension \u201c.net,\u201d are insufficient to alleviate the likelihood of confusion between Complainant\u2019s trademarks and domain names and the disputed domain name; indeed, Complainant contends that the addition of the generic term only increases the risk of confusion.\nComplainant contends that Respondent does not have any rights or legitimate interests regarding the disputed domain name. Complainant has never licensed or otherwise authorized Respondent to use its marks. Complainant contends that Zhuhai Yingxun Keji Limited., the registrant of the disputed domain name as indicated on the WhoIs Database, does not bear any resemblance to the word \u201cambien.\u201d Therefore, Respondent does not have any legitimate interests in using the disputed domain name. Further, Respondent is not using the disputed domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services, so as to confer a right or legitimate interest in it in accordance with paragraph 4(c)(i) of the Policy.\nLastly, Complainant contends that Respondent was clearly aware of Complainant\u2019s distinctive and\nwell-known AMBIEN mark when registering the disputed domain name. The disputed domain name leads to a website offering AMBIEN products for sale. By clicking on the \u201cBUY AMBIEN\u201d links, the Internet user is redirected to websites through which they can buy pharmaceutical products. Respondent has intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to a completing website, by creating a likelihood of confusion with Complainant\u2019s mark and company name as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of Respondent\u2019s website or other location, constituting evidence of bad faith.\nB.
